## News

[FreeBSD Foundation December 2019 Update](https://mailchi.mp/freebsdfoundation/freebsd-foundation-december-2019-update) brings the message from director, review of Foundation-sponsored FreeBSD software development, Foundation's Advocacy work and more.

Another year-review about FreeBSD comes from [Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=BSD-2010-Highlights).

Do you want to contribute to BSD's but don't know how? One of the good way to start is doing translations. [How To: Contributing Language Translations to FreeNAS](https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/how-to-contributing-language-translations-to-freenas/) can help you do that.

[The KDE FreeBSD initiative](https://carlschwan.eu/2019/12/17/freebsd-kde-org-new.html) got a new website. This moves a new site away from the old deprecated KDE Web framework and is more consistent with the other KDE websites, making it easier to maintain and strengthening the KDE brand. Check it out at [freebsd.kde.org](https://freebsd.kde.org).

Visual Studio Code landed in FreeBSD [ports](https://www.freshports.org/editors/vscode/). VS Code is a type of tool that combines the simplicity of a code editor with what developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides comprehensive editing and debugging support, an extensibility model, and lightweight integration with existing tools.

Never enough of BSD news? Latest BSD Now podcast [Happy Holidays, All(an)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn5FCF5890w) talks about Authentication Vulnerabilities in OpenBSD, NetBSD 9.0 RC1 is available, Running FreeNAS on a DigitalOcean droplet, NomadBSD 1.3 is here, at e2k19 nobody can hear you scream, and more.
