[OpenBSD Errata: March 22, 2022 (slaacd)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-march-22-2022-slaacd?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for slaacd have been released for OpenBSD 6.9 and 7.0. Binary updates for the amd64, i386 and arm64 platform are available via the syspatch utility.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-22:13.zfs](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-22-13-zfs?utm_source=bsdweekly): Erratum FreeBSD-EN-22:11.zfs was addressed by a patch which modified a ZFS kernel function that determines whether the in-memory copy of a filesystem object is dirty with respect to its representation on stable storage. The modification contained a bug which could cause the function to return false negatives.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-22:14.tzdata](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-22-14-tzdata?utm_source=bsdweekly): Several changes to future and past timestamps have been recorded in the IANA Time Zone Database after previous FreeBSD releases were released. This affects many users in different parts of the world. Because of these changes, the data in the zoneinfo files need to be updated. If the local timezone on the running system is affected, tzsetup(8) needs to be run to update /etc/localtime.
