[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-22:09.elf](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-22-09-elf?utm_source=bsdweekly): When dumping core and saving process information, proc_getargv() might return an sbuf which have a sbuf_len() of 0 or -1, which is not properly handled. An out-of-bound read can happen when user constructs a specially crafted ps_string, which in turn can cause the kernel to crash.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-22:17.cam](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-22-17-cam?utm_source=bsdweekly): CAM (Common Access Method) is a FreeBSD kernel subsystem which handles various aspects of storage device management. Among other responsibilities, it handles device error recovery and can automatically retransmit commands to peripheral devices when a transient error is encountered. When a CAM-managed device responds to a command with an error condition, CAM may automatically retry the command following some error recovery protocol. For instance, it may send a SCSI START UNIT command to the device before retrying the failed command. In this case, an in-memory copy of the original command is preserved for a later retry. However, a specific portion of the command state was not saved correctly, and upon a retry this could lead to memory corruption. The bug can cause kernel panics or other system-level misbehaviour.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-22:16.kqueue](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-22-16-kqueue?utm_source=bsdweekly): kevent(2) is a system call which provides a generic method of notifying the caller when a caller-specified event happens or a condition holds. One use for kevent(2) is to wait for a specified timeout to elapse. This is implemented by the EVFILT_TIMER filter type. In FreeBSD 13.1, periodic events of type EVFILT_TIMER will return at only half of the requested frequency, following the first event. The bug may cause misbehaviour in software that makes use of periodic kevent(2)-based timers.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-22:18.wifi](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-22-18-wifi?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD's net80211 kernel subsystem provides infrastructure and drivers for IEEE 802.11 wireless (Wi-Fi) communications. FreeBSD-SA-22:02.wifi included a number of improvements to net80211 data validation. Some of these changes were not included in the patch provided for FreeBSD 13.0 and via freebsd-update. The changes were included in the git repository. The interface affected by the missing change is only available to the superuser. The superuser may be able to cause kernel crash.

[OpenBSD Errata: August 12, 2022 (zlib)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-august-12-2022-zlib?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for zlib have been released for OpenBSD 7.0 and 7.1. Binary updates for the amd64, i386 and arm64 platform are available via the syspatch utility.

[/usr/games removed from the default $PATH ](https://www.undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20220810120423&utm_source=bsdweekly): In -current, /usr/games has been removed from the default $PATH. So when you next sit down on a fresh snapshot install and want to do a quick rot13 or do a round of tetris, you may need to specify the full path.

[FreeBSD 13.0 end-of-life](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-13-0-end-of-life?utm_source=bsdweekly): On August 31, 2022, FreeBSD 13.0 will reach end-of-life and will no longer be supported by the FreeBSD Security Team. Users of FreeBSD 13.0 are strongly encouraged to upgrade to a newer release as soon as possible.
