## OpenZFS Merges The New FreeBSD Support

FreeBSD developers have been working on transitioning to using OpenZFS as their ZFS file-system upstream code rather than the dormant Illumos base. That initial FreeBSD support has been mainlined this week into the OpenZFS repository, now providing a common code-base between for the open-source ZFS file-system code between Illumos, FreeBSD, Linux, and work-in-progress macOS.

The FreeBSD code was merged this week into the OpenZFS repository and in turn FreeBSD ports is now making use of this branch.

Compared to the existing ZFS support in FreeBSD, migrating to OpenZFS means better SSD TRIM support, native encryption capabilities, persistent L2ARC, and a variety of new/improved features compared.

Up until this chage, sync writes to a ZVOL were done serially. But with the new code, ZVOLs are processed concurrently with sync writes in parallel. Following this change, "The result is that the throughput of sync writes is tripled."

## Releases

[FuryBSD 2020-Q2 images are available for XFCE, and KDE](https://www.furybsd.org/furybsd-2020-q2-images-are-available-for-xfce-and-kde/?utm_source=bsdweekly). The Q2 2020 images are not a visible leap forward but a functional leap forward.  Most effort was spent creating a better out of box experience for automatic Ethernet configuration, working WiFi, webcam, and improved hypervisor support.  

## BSDSec

[OpenBSD Errata: April 19th, 2020 (drm)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-april-19th-2020-drm?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for the kernel have been released for OpenBSD 6.5 and 6.6. There was an incorrect test for root in the DRM Linux compatiblity code. Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility.As these affect the kernel, a reboot will be needed after patching.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-20:07.quotad](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-announce-freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-20-07-quotad?utm_source=bsdweekly). The Network File System (NFS) allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network.  By using this, users and programs can access files on remote systems almost as if they were local files.

[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-20:10.ipfw](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-announce-freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-20-10-ipfw?utm_source=bsdweekly). The ipfw system facility allows filtering, redirecting, and other operations on IP packets travelling through network interfaces. Incomplete packet data validation may result in accessing out-of-bounds memory (CVE-2019-5614) or may access memory after it has been freed (CVE-2019-15874).

[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-20:11.openssl](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-announce-freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-20-11-openssl?utm_source=bsdweekly). Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the "signature_algorithms_cert" TLS extension.  The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognized signature algorithm is received from the peer.
