## Releases

[HardenedBSD 14-STABLE Now Available](https://hardenedbsd.org/article/shawn-webb/2023-09-11/hardenedbsd-14-stable-now-available?utm_source=bsdweekly): HardenedBSD 14-STABLE is now officially a thing. Haven't seen any changelog, yet.

## BSDSec

[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-23:10.pf](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-23-10-pf?utm_source=bsdweekly): IPv6 fragments may bypass firewall rules written on the assumption all fragments have been reassembled and, as a result, be forwarded or processed by the host.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-23:11.caroot](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-23-11-caroot?utm_source=bsdweekly): Several certificates were added to the bundle after the latest release of FreeBSD 13.2. TLS connections using the missing root certificates as a trust anchor would not be trusted causing an error.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-23:10.pci](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-23-10-pci?utm_source=bsdweekly): The code which allocated the hot-plug interrupt did not allocate MSI-X vectors properly. When attaching to devices which support only MSI-X messages, the interrupt would not be allocated. PCIe hot-plug would fail to work for certain devices. In particular, this affects certain Amazon EC2 instance types which require functional hot-plug support in order to attach network devices.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-23:09.freebsd-update](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-23-09-freebsd-update?utm_source=bsdweekly): freebsd-update incorrectly deleted files in `/etc/` in the event the file to be updated matched the new release and was different than the old release. This has not been an issue previously because the `$FreeBSD$` tag expansion from subversion virtually guaranteed the existing file was going to be different from the new release. With the conversion to git in the 13.x releases, `$FreeBSD$` is no longer expanded, making it much more likely that a file would find this issue.
