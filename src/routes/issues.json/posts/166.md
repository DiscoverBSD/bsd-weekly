Seems like we're a release part of the year. New Midnight 3.1.1 and NetBSD 10 RC1 are here. 

<!-- more -->

## Releases

[MidnightBSD 3.1.1](https://bsdsec.net/articles/midnightbsd-security-midnightbsd-3-1-1?utm_source=bsdweekly): Includes several security fixes plus updates to the mport package manager.

[NetBSD 10.0 RC1 available](https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/netbsd_10_0_rc1_available?utm_source=bsdweekly): The netbsd-10 release branch is more than a year old now, so it is high time the 10.0 release makes it to the front stage. This matches the long time it took for the developement branch to get ready for branching, a lot of development went into this new release.

## BSDSec

[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-23:16.cap_net](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-23-16-cap_net?utm_source=bsdweekly): Casper services allow limiting operations that a process can perform. Each service maintains a specific list of permitted operations. Certain operations can be further restricted, such as specifying which domain names can be resolved. During the verification of limits, the service must ensure that the new set of constraints is a subset of the previous one. In the case of the cap_net service, the currently limited set of domain names was fetched incorrectly. In certain scenarios, if only a list of resolvable domain names was specified without setting any other limitations, the application could submit a new list of domains including include entries not previously in the list.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-23:13.freebsd-update](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-23-13-freebsd-update?utm_source=bsdweekly): Some systems use non-default configurations referred to as "deep" boot environments. Deep boot environments place datasets belonging to the boot environment subordinate to the boot environment dataset itself, rather than elsewhere in the pool structure. This kind of boot environment requires the -r flag to bectl(8) for most operations in order to recurse on these subordinate datasets, but freebsd-update(8) was not recursing when creating a backup boot environment. Without recursing in bectl(8), backups taken of a deep boot environment are not complete snapshots of the system state before the upgrade takes place. This means that it's potentially painful to try and rollback to the pre-upgrade state after the upgrade has completed.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-23:14.regcomp](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-23-14-regcomp?utm_source=bsdweekly): In some instances, the regcomp() implementation would inadvertently sign-extend a character in the regular expression. Additionally, alphabetic wide-characters were not properly being considered as such. Regular expressions supplied to grep(1) or sed(1) that contained an alphabetic wide-character would incorrectly error out as if a bogus trailing backslash had been supplied.

[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-23:15.stdio](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-23-15-stdio?utm_source=bsdweekly): For line-buffered streams the __sflush() function did not correctly update the FILE object's write space member when the write(2) system call returns an error. Depending on the nature of an application that calls libc's stdio functions and the presence of errors returned from the write(2) system call (or an overridden stdio write routine) a heap buffer overfly may occur. Such overflows may lead to data corruption or the execution of arbitrary code at the privilege level of the calling program.
