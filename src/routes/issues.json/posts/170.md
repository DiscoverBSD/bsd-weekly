Users of FreeBSD 12.4 are strongly encouraged to upgrade to a newer release as soon as possible. Note that FreeBSD 12 is the last release series built from the Subversion repository. The git2svn service will be discontinued after December 31, 2023, and the Subversion repository will stop being updated.

[Personal FreeBSD PKGBASE Update Server](https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2023/12/09/personal-freebsd-pkgbase-update-server/?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD UNIX system can be updated in many ways. You can use freebsd-update(8) command to fetch and install the official binary patches. You can download the FreeBSD sources and compile your new version. You can download and install base.txz and kernel.txz sets in a new ZFS Boot Environment along with copying over your config files there. While for most users these three options will be more then enough – there is a small group or people that need something else. Companies. People that like to use custom FreeBSD version or enterprise corporate world that needs to fulfill many compliance regulations. For their multiple reasons – including but not limited to – security – they want to have their own trusted FreeBSD update infra under their control.
