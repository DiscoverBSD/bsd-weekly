## Releases

[ NetBSD 10.0 RC4 available](https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/netbsd_10_0_rc4_available?utm_source=bsdweekly): RC4 became necessary as a few very important DRM/KMS issues especially for Intel GPUs have been resolved. And as an (unexpected) bonus support for the Nintendo Wii has been added to the evbppc port.

[Future of 32-bit platform support in FreeBSD](https://bsdsec.net/articles/future-of-32-bit-platform-support-in-freebsd?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD is deprecating 32-bit platforms over the next couple of major releases. They anticipate FreeBSD 15.0 will not include the armv6, i386, and powerpc platforms, and FreeBSD 16.0 will not include armv7. Support for executing 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels will be retained through at least the lifetime of the stable/16 branch if not longer. (There is currently no plan to remove support for 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels.)

[FreeBSD Foundation Statement on the European Union Cyber Resiliency Act](https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/freebsd-foundation-statement-on-the-european-union-cyber-resiliency-act/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Open source communities, including the FreeBSD Foundation, initially expressed concerns that the CRA could subject open source projects, communities, and developers to the same security procedures and potential fines as commercial entities. The FreeBSD Foundation gratefully acknowledges the efforts made during the legislative process to raise and address these concerns and welcomes the revisions made in the final version of the CRA. The final version improves important exclusions of open source projects, communities, foundations, and their development and package distribution platforms.
