[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-24:09.zfs](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-24-09-zfs?utm_source=bsdweekly): Because ZFS may consume large amounts of RAM to cache various types of filesystem objects, it continuously monitors system RAM available to decide whether to shrink its caches. Some caches are shrunk using a dedicated thread, to which work is dispatched asynchronously. In some cases, the cache shrinking logic may dispatch excessive amounts of work to the "ARC pruning" thread, causing it to continue attempting to shrink caches even after resource shortages are resolved.

[FreeBSD: The torchbearer of the original operating system distribution](https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/freebsd-the-torchbearer-of-the-original-operating-system-distribution/?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD is a category-defining open source operating system that carries forward the original Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) legacy, pioneered by the University of California, Berkeley Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) in the 1970s and 1980s. Although the term “distribution” is now widely associated with Linux, its origins can be traced back to BSD’s innovative approach. Unlike Linux distributions, which are modular and fragmented, FreeBSD takes a holistic approach to system development, providing a cohesive software bundle that includes the kernel, userspace, utilities, libraries, and documentation. This original concept set a standard for delivering a complete open source operating system to end users.
