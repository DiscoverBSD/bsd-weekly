## Releases

[NetBSD 8.3 released and end of support for netbsd-8](https://bsdsec.net/articles/netbsd-8-3-released-and-end-of-support-for-netbsd-8?utm_source=bsdweekly): The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce NetBSD 8.3, the third and final release from the NetBSD 8 stable branch. It represents a selected subset of fixes deemed important for security or stability reasons since the release of NetBSD 8.2 in March 2020, as well as some enhancements backported from the development branch. It is fully compatible with NetBSD 8.0. This also represents the end-of-life for the netbsd-8 release branch. No further security updates will happen. Users running 8.2 or an earlier release are strongly recommended to upgrade to a newer branch, preferably the recent NetBSD 10.0 release. Pkgsrc has already desupported the netbsd-8 branch.
