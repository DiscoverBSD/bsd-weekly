## Releases

[OPNsense 24.1.9 released](https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=41107.msg201461#msg201461&utm_source=bsdweekly): This is the last bit of preparation for the upcoming 24.7 series reimplementing one-to-one NAT using MVC/API and a number of plumbing changes. IPv6 has also been improved with the dhcp6c client having received a number of new fixes and features.

## BSDSec

[FreeBSD 13.2 end-of-life](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-13-2-end-of-life?utm_source=bsdweekly): As of July 1st, 2024, FreeBSD 13.2 will reach end-of-life and will no longer be supported by the FreeBSD Security Team. Users of FreeBSD 13.2 are strongly encouraged to upgrade to a newer release as soon as possible. The currently supported branches and releases and their expected end-of-life dates are available at the article.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-24:13.libc++](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-24-13-libc?utm_source=bsdweekly): C++14 and later supports size-aware deletion of heap objects, when the compiler is able to determine at compile time what the exact size of a particular object is. For this purpose, there are specific variants of "operator delete" that take an additional size_t argument. If such a variant is called, the size is passed through to the underlying allocator, which can optionally utilize this size for for more efficient deallocation. A recent change in libc++'s implementation of std::string has introduced a potential mismatch between the actual size allocated on the heap for the contained string, and the size that is passed to "operator delete" when the string is eventually destroyed.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-24:12.killpg](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-24-12-killpg?utm_source=bsdweekly): The code designed to prevent lock order reversals between killpg(2) and fork(2) did not wait for lock availability before retrying to acquire a lock, which could result in a livelock causing very high system load.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-24:11.ldns](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-24-11-ldns?utm_source=bsdweekly): Due to a bug in the library's configuration file parser, commented out configuration settings in /etc/resolv.conf were picked up by the LDNS resolver, potentially leading to malfunction and/or information leakage. This included, but was not limited to, the nameserver setting.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-24:10.zfs](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-24-10-zfs?utm_source=bsdweekly): When writing data to a file on ZFS, the kernel may need to handle soft page faults that can occur when accessing user data. When doing so, in some cases ZFS needs to undo an earlier kernel buffer allocation. A bug in the handling of these cases causes this buffer to be leaked.

While the solution is entirely documented into man pages and in the official FAQ, it may not be easy to find it at first glance, especially since most operating system allow to mount an iso file in a single step where as OpenBSD requires an extra step.
