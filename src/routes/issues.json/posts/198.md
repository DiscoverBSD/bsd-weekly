[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-24:06.ktrace](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-24-06-ktrace?utm_source=bsdweekly): The bug may be used by an unprivileged user to read the contents of files to which they would not otherwise have access, such as the local password database.

[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-24:05.pf](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-24-05-pf?utm_source=bsdweekly): ICMPv6 packets with identifier value of zero bypass firewall rules written on the assumption that the incoming packets are going to create a state in the state table.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-24:14.ifconfig](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-24-14-ifconfig?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD hosts which still rely on default network mask assignment and have addresses in the old class A (0.0.0.0-127.255.255.255) or class C (192.0.0.0-223.255.255.255) ranges will have an incorrect network mask. The exact consequences will vary depending on the direction of the error and the relative positions of the affected host and its default router within the local address space. Affected hosts should still be able to communicate with at least a subset of their local network, and may also be able to communicate with a subset of the wider network, but will typically lose the ability to communicate with any address which is not within both the actual local address space and the misconfigured local address space. This may include their default router.
