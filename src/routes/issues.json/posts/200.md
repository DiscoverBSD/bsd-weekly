[FreeBSD Ports and Packages: What you need to know](https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/freebsd-ports-and-packages-what-you-need-to-know/?utm_source=bsdweekly): There’s a common misconception that third-party software for FreeBSD must be built from source using the ports tree. However, FreeBSD has long provided an official package collection, offering over 34,000 packages at the time of writing. The current package management tool, pkg(8), available since 2014, offers much more flexibility than the original pkg_install created by Jordan Hubbard in 1993. Thus, for most users, installing software on FreeBSD using the official packages is more efficient and straightforward.
