## Releases

[GhostBSD 24.07.1 Is Now Available](https://ghostbsd.org/news/GhostBSD_24.07.1_Is_Now_Available?utm_source=bsdweekly): This release, though a bit delayed, brings a significant change. They have transitioned from building our OS packages from their OS ports to building them from FreeBSD PKGBSD. This change, while involving extensive testing, promises improved performance and stability. If you have not updated to 24.04.2, a backup and reinstallation with 24.07.1 is recommended. Please note that the change to PKGBSD and the OS update to 24.07.1 could cause issues, as the update manager was only set to upgrade GhostBSD to PKGBSD from a minor version.

[FreeBSD 13.4-RC2](https://www.freebsd.org/news/newsflash/#2024-08-31:1?utm_source=bsdweekly): The second Release Candidate build for the FreeBSD 13.4 release cycle is now available. ISO images for the amd64, i386, powerpc, powerpc64, powerpc64le, powerpcspe, armv6, armv7, aarch64, and riscv64 architectures are FreeBSD mirror sites.
