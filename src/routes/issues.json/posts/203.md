## Releases

[FreeBSD 13.4-RELEASE](https://www.freebsd.org/news/newsflash/#2024-09-17:1?utm_source=bsdweekly): The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is pleased to announce the availability of FreeBSD 13.4-RELEASE. This is the fifth release of the stable/13 branch. Since this release is occurring late in a legacy stable branch, there are few new features; rather, the focus is primarily on maintenance. As such, changes since 13.3-RELEASE consist mostly of bug fixes, driver updates, and new versions of externally-maintained software.

[GhostBSD 24.07.3](https://ghostbsd.org/news/GhostBSD_24.07.3_Is_Now_Available?utm_source=bsdweekly): This release fixes issues found in 24.07.1 and 24.07.2, bringing important enhancements, bug fixes, and new features. Key improvements include setting vital system and software packages, adding support to mark packages as vital, and including hgame in kld_list. Notably, they resolved the legacy boot issue where the live session wouldn't start due to missing gzip in the BIOS /boot/loader. They’ve also ensured /etc/X11 is properly created during setup.
