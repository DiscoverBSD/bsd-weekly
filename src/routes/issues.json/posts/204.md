## Releases

[FreeBSD 13.4-RELEASE](https://www.freebsd.org/news/newsflash/#2024-09-17:1?utm_source=bsdweekly): The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is pleased to announce the availability of FreeBSD 13.4-RELEASE. This is the fifth release of the stable/13 branch. Since this release is occurring late in a legacy stable branch, there are few new features; rather, the focus is primarily on maintenance. As such, changes since 13.3-RELEASE consist mostly of bug fixes, driver updates, and new versions of externally-maintained software.

## BSDSec

[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-24:16.libnv](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-24-16-libnv?utm_source=bsdweekly): It is possible for an attacker to overwrite portions of memory (in userland or the kernel) as the allocated buffer might be smaller than the data received from a malicious process. This vulnerability could result in privilege escalation or cause a system panic.

[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-24:15.bhyve](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-24-15-bhyve?utm_source=bsdweekly): A malicious, privileged software running in a guest VM can exploit the vulnerability to crash the hypervisor process or potentially achieve code execution on the host in the bhyve userspace process, which typically runs as root. Note that bhyve runs in a Capsicum sandbox, so malicious code is constrained by the capabilities available to the bhyve process.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-24:16.pf](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-24-16-pf?utm_source=bsdweekly): Patches for a previous security advisory, FreeBSD-SA-24:05, were incomplete and introduced some overly strict pf state tracking for ICMPv6 packets.

[OpenBSD Errata: September 17, 2024 (expat nfs readdir elf)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-september-17-2024-expat-nfs-readdir-elf?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for libexpat and kernel have been released for OpenBSD 7.5 and 7.4. Binary updates for the amd64, arm64 and i386 platform are available via the syspatch utility.
