## [Submit Your FreeBSD Project Proposal](https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/blog/submit-your-freebsd-project-proposal/?utm_source=bsdweekly)

Do you have a project you’d like to work on that would improve FreeBSD?

The FreeBSD Foundation is still soliciting the submission of proposals for work that directly benefits any of the major subsystems or infrastructure within the FreeBSD operating system.

Proposals will be accepted for work on any of the subsystems or infrastructure in FreeBSD, although the Foundation is particularly interested in receiving project grant proposals in a few key areas:

- Installation and deployment tooling, including pkgbase
- Containerization improvements, such as jail orchestration or Docker compatibility
- Improving the security of FreeBSD and of applications running on FreeBSD
- Development tooling, such as debuggers, fuzzers, static analysis tools
- Establishes FreeBSD as a leader in projects with multiple operating system support, for example ZFS, LLVM, or libarchive
- Developing improvements to ports infrastructure and tooling

## Releases

[FreeBSD 11.4-RC1 Available](https://www.freebsd.org/news/newsflash.html#event20200522:01?utm_source=bsdweekly). The first RC build for the FreeBSD 11.4 release cycle is now available. ISO images for the amd64, armv6, arm64, i386, powerpc, powerpc64, and sparc64 architectures are available on most of FreeBSD mirror sites.

[FuguIta 6.7 released](http://fuguita.org/index.php?FuguIta%2F6.7&utm_source=bsdweekly). FuguIta is OpenBSD live system. This is a first test release of 6.7. Fast-boot-cache has not been installed yet.

[OPNsense 20.1.7 released](https://opnsense.org/opnsense-20-1-7-released/?utm_source=bsdweekly). OPNsense moves to PHP 7.3 in order to be able to complete testing for the 20.7-BETA online upgrades. It also included is a patch for the packet filter kernel code which could crash with shared forwarding when interfaces disappeared due to use after free in the default network stack path.

## BSDSec

Errata patches for LibreSSL have been released for OpenBSD 6.7  and OpenBSD 6.6.

- [OpenBSD Errata: May 22nd, 2020 (libssl)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-may-22nd-2020-libssl)- a TLS client with peer verification disabled may crash when contacting a server that sends an empty certificate list,
- [OpenBSD Errata: May 22nd, 2020 (unbound)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-may-22nd-2020-unbound) - specially crafted queries may crash unbound and unwind. Both can be tricked into amplifying an incoming query,
- [OpenBSD Errata: May 25th, 2020 (smtpd_sockaddr)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-may-25th-2020-smtpd_sockaddr?utm_source=bsdweekly) -  Incorrect use of getpeername(2) storage for outgoing IPv6 connections corrupts stack memory. The nature of the corruption and existing mitigations appear to make this difficult to effectively target.

Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility. After patching, restart affected services.

As always, it's worth following [BSDSec](https://bsdsec.net). RSS feeds and Twitter account available.

## News

[DarkMate 12.1 is a desktop install script for FreeBSD 12.1](https://github.com/broozar/installDesktopFreeBSD?utm_source=bsdweekly). This script helps you set up a desktop system on top of FreeBSD 12.1. It will install PKG, X, MATE, SLiM, some additional tools and set up a 'wheel video' user.

In a commit touching quite a few files, [Theo recently renamed the installation images from `installXX.fs` to `installXX.img`](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20200520093232&utm_source=bsdweekly). These are UFS filesystem images, but additionally have a bootblock in the first 8K (since UFS does not use that space). There are some UEFI direct-from-internet bootloaders that require the name `*.img`. So this makes things more convenient for those, while keeping it consistent in all architectures.

[LibreSSL 3.1.2 have been released](https://bsdsec.net/articles/libressl-3-1-2-released?utm_source=bsdweekly). It includes the following fix: A TLS client with peer verification disabled may crash when contacting a server that sends an empty certificate list.

[BSD Hardware](https://bsd-hardware.info/?utm_source=bsdweekly): This is a project to collect hardware details of BSD-powered computers over the world and help BSD users and developers to collaboratively debug hardware related issues, check for BSD-compatibility and find drivers. Make a probe of your computer in order to participate and discover the world of hardware in details. Share your probes and logs with BSD developers to debug and fix problems on your computer.


This short blog post summarizes the [KDE/Qt work done in OpenBSD 6.7 and plans for 6.8](https://www.sizeofvoid.org/posts/2020-05-20-openbsd-kde-status/?utm_source=bsdweekly).

## Tutorials

[FreeBSD Laptop: Dell Latitude 7390](https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2020-05-22-my-new-FreeBSD-laptop-Dell-7390.html?utm_source=bsdweekly). FreeBSD developer explains why they decided to get this laptop, and how to get the most of it with FreeBSD. FYI, they run KDE. At the end of article you can find the list of things that do and don't work.

[Setting Up Windows iSCSI Block Shares on TrueNAS & FreeNAS](https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/iscsi-shares-on-truenas-freenas/?utm_source=bsdweekly). In this tutorial, we’ll cover the basics of iSCSI, configuring iSCSI on FreeNAS (soon to be TrueNAS CORE), and setting up access from a Windows machine.

[Upgrade your OpenBSD VM](https://openbsd.amsterdam/upgrade.html?utm_source=bsdweekly). OpenBSD 6.7 has been released last week. There are two ways you can upgrade your VM. Either use sysupgrade(8) or do a manual upgrade.
