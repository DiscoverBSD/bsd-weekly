## National FreeBSD day

National FreeBSD Day on **June 19th** commemorates the launch date of an innovative technology that many of us use every day.

FreeBSD Foundation founded National FreeBSD Day to recognize its pioneering and continuing impact on technology and honor its legacy. Commemorating the launch date of FreeBSD, June 19th, was selected.

On June 15, 2017, the Registrar at[ National Day Calendar](https://nationaldaycalendar.com/national-freebsd-day-june-19/) declared the day to be officially observed on June 19th, annually.
