## News

[FreeBSD Foundation got a new look](https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/weve-got-a-new-look/?utm_source=bsdweekly): The Foundation team is excited to announce a new look for heir website. They hope you’ll find the new site easier to read and navigate. They’ve also added a FreeBSD Resources section that includes links to how-to guides and other community training resources.They’re also unveiling a 20th Anniversary logo.

[libressl updated in DragonFly](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/2020/07/29/24789.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): In Daniel Fojt’s ongoing series of third-party software upgrades, he’s moved libreSSL in DragonFly up a major version, from 2.9.1 to 3.1.3. This includes TLS 1.3, among other features.

[DragonFlyBSD Pulls In AMD Temperature Driver, SMN Support From FreeBSD](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=DragonFlyBSD-AMD-TEMP-SMN&utm_source=bsdweekly): DragonFlyBSD has been generally working out well for AMD Zen systems sans a few motherboard specific woes, but now is getting even better thanks to importing some new drivers from FreeBSD. Most exciting is the amdtemp driver now being imported from FreeBSD to DragonFlyBSD. This driver allows for temperature monitoring on AMD Family 0Fh, 10h, 11h, 12h, 14h, 15h, 16h, and 17h processors. The AMD Family 17h support covers Zen 1 as well as Zen 2, including the likes of Threadripper and EPYC. Also imported from FreeBSD is the amdsmn driver. This driver is for the AMD System Management Network (SMN) support on AMD Zen systems.

## Tutorials

[Testing Linux Steam Proton on GhostBSD (FreeBSD) with BSD linuxulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8ihW0m3bRQ&utm_source=bsdweekly): BSD user tries running windows games with linux steam. There's audio but obs cannot record it. 64 bit games are running nicely with performance similar to linux. Due to obs, there's fps drop.

[FreeBSD Virtual Data Centre with Potluck: DevOps & Infrastructure as Code](https://honeyguide.eu/posts/virtual-dc1/?utm_source=bsdweekly): One of the main complaints about FreeBSD is the lack of Docker and Kubernetes, which in turn is seen as inability to use FreeBSD as a platform for bleeding edge concepts like micro services and scale-out container orchestration. This article series shows that FreeBSD also contains (more than) a complete selection of tools required to run a Virtual Datacenter (vDC). Beside showcasing the power of FreeBSD as a platform, this article series should give an idea of the concept of Potluck. While admittedly it is still in very early stages, it has the potential to be to complex container images and sets of different interdependent container images (like nomad, consul and traefik) what the FreeBSD package collection is to individual applications: Depending on your network speed, setting up the core configuration of consul, nomad and traefik in step 3 with the Potluck images will only take a few minutes.

[Updating pkg when pkg is broken](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/2020/08/03/24805.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): Have you ever broke a pkg on DragonFly machine? Well, if you do, you can use pkg-static to fix it.
