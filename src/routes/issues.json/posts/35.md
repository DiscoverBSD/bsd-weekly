## What's the oldest BSD  

There are many actively developed BSD-based OSes, but can you guess which one is the oldest one?

[This YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww60o940kEk&utm_source=bsdweekly) tries to answer.

## Releases

[OpenBSD 6.8-beta tagged in CVS](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20200831192811&utm_source=bsdweekly): Theo (deraadt@) has just committed the crank to 6.8-beta to CVS. You are welcome to test snapshots and report any issues you find, both in the base systems as in the supplied packages, so that the upcoming 6.8 release does not have surprise issues.

## BSDSec

Seems to be none last week.

As always, it's worth following [BSDSec](https://bsdsec.net). [RSS feed](https://bsdsec.net/articles.atom) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/bsdsec) available.

## News

GhostBSD has published their [financial reports from January to June 2020](https://ghostbsd.org/financial_reports_from_January_to_June_2020?utm_source=bsdweekly). The total amount donated was $5,341.75. Keep donations going!

[Modernizing the OpenBSD console](https://www.cambus.net/modernizing-the-openbsd-console/?utm_source=bsdweekly): What console framework does OpenBSD use, what were the improvements in last few years and what could be next?

[GSoC 2020: Report-2: Fuzzing the NetBSD Network Stack in a Rumpkernel Environment](https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/gsoc_2020_report_2_fuzzing?utm_source=bsdweekly): This report was written by Nisarg S. Joshi as part of Google Summer of Code 2020. The objective of this project is to fuzz the various protocols and layers of the network stack of NetBSD using rumpkernel.

## Tutorials

[How to build a name server with DNS over TLS (DoT)](https://www.bsdhowto.ch/externaldns.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): This post is about configuring `nsd(8)` as a public name server for your own domain, providing DNS over TLS (DoT). Everything needed for this task is already there in OpenBSD base installation. You don't need to install a single additional package for this.

[FreeBSD Fridays: An Introduction to FreeBSD Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-7xZB0afyA&utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD is known for its stability and security. Join Antranig Vartanian as he walks you through an introduction to FreeBSD Security including the IPFW firewall for workstations and server, Security Event Auditing and more.

[FreeBSD configure AWS SES with Postfix MTA](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/freebsd-configure-aws-ses-with-postfix-mta/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is a hosted email service for you to send and receive email using your email addresses and domains. Typically SES used for sending bulk email or routing emails without hosting MTA with help of cloud servers provided by AWS. We can use Perl/Python/PHP APIs to send an email via SES. In this tutorial we are going to configure FreeBSD server or jail running Postfix to route all outgoing emails via AWS SES.

[Minimal OpenBSD Virtual Machine](https://medium.com/@AliFarzanrad/minimal-openbsd-virtual-machine-94dcd06dacf?utm_source=bsdweekly): OpenBSD has its own hypervisor (vmm) for few years. Itâ€™s primary goal is to run OpenBSD guests. Recently I played around vmm to create a minimal virtual machine without a virtual disk! It is useful when you need to create lots of similar virtual machines without worrying about accidental data corruption by them.

[FreeBSD configure AWS SES with Postfix MTA](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/freebsd-configure-aws-ses-with-postfix-mta/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) is a hosted email service for you to send and receive email using your email addresses and domains. Typically SES used for sending bulk email or routing emails without hosting MTA with help of cloud servers provided by AWS. We can use Perl/Python/PHP APIs to send an email via SES.

## More

As always, there are more sources of BSD goodness. Latest [BSD Now](https://www.bsdnow.tv/365?utm_source=bsdweekly) talks about FreeBSD USB Audio, Kyua: An introduction for NetBSD users, Keeping backup ZFS on Linux kernel modules around, CLI Tools 235x Faster than Hadoop, FreeBSD Laptop Battery Life Status Command, and more.

The Valuable News weekly series is dedicated to providing summary about news, articles and other interesting stuff mostly but not always related to the UNIX or BSD systems. The latest is from [2020-08-31](https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2020/08/31/valuable-news-2020-08-31/?utm_source=bsdweekly).

[In Other BSDs for 2020/08/29](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/2020/08/29/24886.html?utm_source=bsdweekly) is out, too.
