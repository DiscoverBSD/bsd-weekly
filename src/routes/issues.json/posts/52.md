<!-- more -->

## Releases

[FreeBSD Desktop for PineBook Pro](https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/freebsd-desktop-for-pinebook-pro.78269/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Unofficial user-built images for PineBook Pro based on 12.2-STABLE and 13.0.

## BSDSec

[OpenBSD Errata: January 11th, 2021 (nd6)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-january-11th-2021-nd6?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for the kernel have been released for OpenBSD 6.7 and 6.8. When an NDP entry is invalidated the associated layer 2 address is not invalidated. Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility. As these affect the kernel, a reboot will be needed after patching.

As always, it's worth following [BSDSec](https://bsdsec.net). [RSS feed](https://bsdsec.net/articles.atom) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/bsdsec) available.

## News

> This issue of BSD Weekly was brought to you by [`Homura`](https://codeberg.org/Alexander88207/Homura/?utm_source=bsdweekly), Wine-based Game Launcher for FreeBSD.


[XFCE 4.16 in FreeBSD ports](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports?view=revision&revision=559953&utm_source=bsdweekly): This XFCE release dropped support for GTK2 plugins and also dropped GTK2 from all components.

[pkgsrc-2020Q4 released](https://bsdsec.net/articles/pkgsrc-2020q4-released?utm_source=bsdweekly): The pkgsrc developers are proud to announce the 69th quarterly release of pkgsrc, the cross-platform packaging system. pkgsrc is available with more than 24,000 packages, running on 23 separate platforms. Special note for users of pkgsrc on NetBSD: The default package database location has changed from /var/db/pkg to /usr/pkg/pkgdb. While there is compatibility code that will quietly use the old location, users are advised to explicitly set the database path whether or not they migrate the database, especially if they have taken intermediate or partial migration steps.

[vkernels broken for now in Dragonfly](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/2021/01/08/25335.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): MAP_VPAGETABLE has been removed in DragonFly because of conflicts with recent pmap work. This has the unfortunate effect of breaking vkernel(7), but vkernels can be resurrected with changes to use hardware virtualization support. Note that running DragonFly as a VM is unaffected; thatâ€™ll still work just fine. This breakage is DragonFly-vkernel-on-DragonFly specific.

## Tutorials

[Self-host a password manager on OpenBSD](https://www.tumfatig.net/20210105/self-host-a-password-manager-on-openbsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): One of possible solutions for following requirements:

 - Access and manage passwords from iOS devices
 - Filling credentials in iOS apps
 - Accessible and manageable from an OpenBSD and MacOS workstation

[Routing and Firewalling VLANS with FreeBSD](https://klarasystems.com/articles/routing-and-firewalling-vlans-with-freebsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): In this article we are going to look at and integrate two network isolation technologies, VLANs and VNET. VLANs are common place, and if you have done some network management or design then you are likely to have interacted with them. The second are FreeBSDs VNET virtual network stacks, a powerful network stack isolation technology that gives FreeBSD jails super powers.

[Setup and configure Offshore 100% Logless VPN server on FreeBSD 12.2](https://ozgur.kazancci.com/setup-softether-vpn-server-on-freebsd-12-2-windows-10-as-clients/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Installation of a Japanese VPN: SoftEther VPN server on FreeBSD 12.2, explaining how to configure it being completely offshore, 100% logless with every aspect of details.
