[OpenBSD Errata: February 24th, 2021 (pffrag)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-february-24th-2021-pffrag?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for the kernel have been released for OpenBSD 6.7 and 6.8. A sequence of overlapping IPv4 fragments could crash the kernel in pf due to an assertion. Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility. As these affect the kernel, a reboot will be needed after patching.

## News

[Tracing the History of ARM and FreeBSD](https://klarasystems.com/articles/tracing-the-history-of-arm-and-freebsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD developers started working on support for 32-bit ARM chips during FreeBSD 6.0. (For reference, this was 4 years before the Raspberry Pi was introduced.) The support for 32-bit ARM was officially added to the kernel in FreeBSD 7.0 in February of 2008. Support for 64-bit ARM processors was added a few years later in FreeBSD 11 in October 2016.

[A comparison between mports and FreeBSD ports](https://www.justjournal.com/users/mbsd/entry/33870?utm_source=bsdweekly): MidnightBSD mports started as a refactor of the FreeBSD ports with some influence from OpenBSD many years ago. Read the post to learn more about what's still similar and what has changed over years.

[resolvd(8) - daemon to handle nameserver configuration](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20210225084959&utm_source=bsdweekly): Florian Obser (florian@) imported resolvd(8), a daemon for handling nameserver configuration.

## Tutorials

[BastilleBSD on MidnightBSD](https://www.justjournal.com/users/mbsd/entry/33869?utm_source=bsdweekly): MidnightBSD has recently added a new port, mports/sysutils/bastille that allows you to manage containers. This is a port of a project that originally targetted FreeBSD, but also works on HardenedBSD.

[Side-loading FreeBSD versions using Boot Environments](https://people.freebsd.org/~dch/posts/2021-02-23-sideloading-freebsd.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): Or upgrading a FreeBSD box the dirty way. This is very much a “works on my machine” approach but it should get you 90% of the way to dealing with your own. Expect annoying breakages and minor fixes along the way.
