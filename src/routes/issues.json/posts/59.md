## News

[New games on DragonFly](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/2021/03/02/25504.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): New to DragonFly, but not new to games. Aarom LI has added several old–school BSD games back to DragonFly mostly via NetBSD. It’s `ching(6)`, `gomoku(6)`, `monop(6)`, and `cgram(6)`.

[helloSystem got first statistical report on BSD-Hardware.info](https://github.com/bsdhw/Trends/tree/master/Dist/helloSystem?utm_source=bsdweekly): The system has found the required number of users to get its first statistical report on BSD-Hardware.info portal as it was done earlier by FreeBSD, OpenBSD and OPNsense. You can see in the report which hardware/software components are preferred by users of this OS. The report is available to clone from the GitHub repository.

[Top 12 best opensource games available on OpenBSD](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2021-03-07-openbsd-best-games.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): This article features the 12 best games (in authors opinion) in term of quality and fun available in OpenBSD packages. The list only contains open source games that you can install out of the box. This means that game engines requiring proprietary (or paid) game assets are not part of this list.

## Tutorials

[Manage containers on Raspberry Pi with this open source tool](https://opensource.com/article/21/3/bastille-raspberry-pi?utm_source=bsdweekly): In-depth article on opensource.com describing container use on the Raspberry Pi using Bastille. Covers installation of FreeBSD 13.0 (beta), installing and configuring Bastille, creating jails and working with templates.

[FreeBSD Network Troubleshooting: Understanding Network Performance](https://klarasystems.com/articles/freebsd-network-troubleshooting-understanding-network-performance/?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD has a full set of debugging features, and the network stack is able to report a ton of information. So much that it can be hard to figure out what is relevant and what is not.

[Quick-publishing of poudriere packages](https://euroquis.nl/freebsd/2021/03/08/poudriere.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): An essential tool in the FreeBSD porter’s arsenal (“porters” are the people who package third-party software, software like KDE Plasma, Haskell, ..) is poudriere, which is an evolution of the old tinderbox. It leverages ZFS and FreeBSD jails to do clean, consistent builds even on an otherwise occupied workstation, and can build for OS versions and architectures you’re not even running. Using the packages you’ve built can be slightly harder, so here’s some notes.

[Side-loading FreeBSD versions using Boot Environments](https://people.freebsd.org/~dch/posts/2021-02-23-sideloading-freebsd.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): Sometimes using boot environments is not sufficient to upgrade a FreeBSD ZFS installation. Side-loading is creating an empty boot environment, and then moving in the bits you need. Some breakage may occur along the way.

[Using Restic for fast backups and restores](https://people.freebsd.org/~dch/posts/2021-03-05-restic-backups.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): Set up your own BSD backups using restic, with zfs and tar for good measure. Restic also allows multiple backends, so you can store these on your own infrastructure, or almost anywhere else in the world.

## More

As always, there are more sources of BSD goodness. Latest [BSD Now](https://www.bsdnow.tv/392?utm_source=bsdweekly) talks about FreeBSD 13 BETA Benchmarks, FreeBSD Jails Deep Dive by Klara Systems, FreeBSD Foundation looking for a Senior Arm Kernel Engineer & OSS Project Coordinator, macOS-Inspired BSD Desktop OS by helloSystem, A Trip into FreeBSD and more.
