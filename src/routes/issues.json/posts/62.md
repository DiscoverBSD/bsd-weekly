## [NetBSD donations and financial report for 2020 ](https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/hitting_donation_milestone_financial_report?utm_source=bsdweekly)

NetBSD nearly hit their 2020 donation milestone set after the release of 9.0 of $50,000. These donations have enabled them to fund significant work on NetBSD in 2020 such as:

- an aarch64 package build server, victory.netbsd.org. Thanks to Western Washington University for hosting this machine.
- Modernizing wi-fi network stack and release engineering work by Martin Husemann
- LLDB support by Michał Górny
- ptrace and GDB improvements by Kamil Rytarowski

If you are interested in seeing more work like this, please consider donating via PayPal or GitHub sponsors. [The financial report for 2020](https://www.netbsd.org/foundation/reports/financial/2020.html) is also available.

## Releases

[FreeBSD 13.0-RC4 Released With POWER Fixes, Other Bugs Addressed](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=FreeBSD-13.0-RC4-Released&utm_source=bsdweekly): Last week saw FreeBSD 13.0-RC3 released as an "extra" build due to the fallout from the last minute WireGuard situation. Due to other bugs, FreeBSD 13.0-RC4 was issued today rather than going for the final release. FreeBSD 13.0-RC4 is now the second unplanned/as-needed release candidate ahead of the big FreeBSD 13.0 debut. FreeBSD 13.0-RC4 fixes an issue with scripted installations and also has several PowerPC fixes. FreeBSD 13.0-RC4 is also rounded out by a NETMAP memory leak fix, an issue with lock-unbound and some IPv6 deployments, updated to OpenSSL 1.1.1k over its recent security issues, and other various bug fixes.

## BSDSec

[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-21:07.openssl ](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-announce-freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-21-07-openssl?utm_source=bsdweekly): This advisory covers two distinct OpenSSL issues: The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the mplementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. A TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello message sent to a TLS server that omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension results in a NULL pointer dereference in the server.

As always, it's worth following [BSDSec](https://bsdsec.net). [RSS feed](https://bsdsec.net/articles.atom) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/bsdsec) available.

## News

## Tutorials

[FreeBSD on arm64 In The Cloud ](https://klarasystems.com/articles/the-next-level-freebsd-on-arm64-in-the-cloud/?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD/arm64 is the FreeBSD port to the 64-bit ARM architecture, also known as AArch64 or ARMv8. All supported FreeBSD releases include support for ARMv8 and there are many packages and ports (3rd party applications) available to support the software you normally deploy with FreeBSD.
