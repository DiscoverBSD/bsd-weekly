[OPNsense 21.1.5 released ](https://opnsense.org/opnsense-21-1-5-released/?utm_source=bsdweekly): This is mainly a security and reliablility update. There are several FreeBSD security advisories and updates for third party tools such as curl. The historic bsdinstaller has been replaced by a scriptable alternative based on the readily available bsdinstall bundled with the base system.

## News

[OPNsense and HardenedBSD are parting ways](https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=22761.msg108313#msg108313&utm_source=bsdweekly): With FreeBSD 13 released and the gaining interest for security, they think it is now time to change their strategy a bit and focus their efforts further on FreeBSD to help improve security as much as they can. In time there is a risk that HardenedBSD additions are less compatible with new FreeBSD security features. For this reason they are aiming to incorporate FreeBSD 13.x into OPNsense 22.1 in January 2022. Since Shawn (from HardenedBSD) has been a core team member due to the involvement into their operating system, they decided to remove him from their core team as well. Obviously they wish HardenedBSD and Shawn a bright future, maybe in time more of the original concepts and ideas will land in FreeBSD.

[Why You Should Use BSD Licensing for Your Next Open Source Project or Product](https://klarasystems.com/articles/why-you-should-use-bsd-licensing-for-your-next-open-source-project-or-product/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Open source licensing is an integral part of any open source project. Understanding what the limitations of each type of licensing is is as much legal work as it is an art. In our most recent article we talk about the ease of the BSD licensing model and why you should consider it going forward.
