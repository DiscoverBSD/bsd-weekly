## Tutorials

[NomadBSD - An Amazing OS For USB Drives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxDscVR25-o&utm_source=bsdweekly): NomadBSD is a FreeBSD based operating system which is intended to run from USB drives. They recently released their newest version, NomadBSD 130R-20210508. This version is is based on the FreeBSD 13.0 release. In this video we have a run through the desktop and the included applications. Towards the end we use NomadBSD's installer to copy installed system to another hard drive.

[FreeBSD on the Pine H6](https://euroquis.nl/freebsd/2021/05/14/h6.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): Pine makes a bunch of different bits of hardware. The Pine64 was a bit of a breakthrough in single-board-computing (SBC) – very different from the Raspberry Pi, and a lot more open-source. We could argue about just how open it is, but it did spawn the Pinebook and the Pinebook Pro. We hear the latter is really nice, and runs OpenBSD and FreeBSD too. Somewhat forgotten amongst all these is the Pine H6.

[DragonFly pkg 5.8 to 6 quickfix](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/2021/05/13/25754.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): If you are upgrading an older 5.8.x system to DragonFly 6, and get a lua error when updating pkg: manually copy over a config file, and you’ll be set.

[NomadBSD 130R-20210508 Visual Tour - Video](https://youtu.be/GJzWMaHNR34?utm_source=bsdweekly): A visual tour of NomadBSD 130R-20210505, with special focus on UI elements & important applications included.

[Running Potluck Images with runj](https://honeyguide.eu/posts/potluck-runj-poc/?utm_source=bsdweekly): The Potluck container image library wants to provide complex services out of the box, like e.g. a complete postfix secondary mailserver. Many of the images are prepared to be orchestrated via nomad and nomad-pot-driver. This small how-to shows that these jails can also very easily be started via the new runj utility, which is the first step to prepare a tasty OCI and containerd Potluck.

[Basics of ZFS Snapshot Management](https://klarasystems.com/articles/basics-of-zfs-snapshot-management/?utm_source=bsdweekly): One of the many powerful features of OpenZFS are snapshots. OpenZFS stands out in its snapshot design, providing powerful and easy-to-use tools for managing snapshots. Snapshots complement a backup strategy, as they are instantaneous and don’t require a backup window. Since snapshots are atomic, they are not affected by other processes and you don’t have to stop any running applications before taking a snapshot. In this article we’ll start with the basics: creating, using, and deleting file system snapshots.
