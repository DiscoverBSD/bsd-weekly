## Releases

[OPNsense 21.1.6 released](https://opnsense.org/opnsense-21-1-6-released/?utm_source=bsdweekly): With a bit of delay it bring to you the usual mix of security and reliablilty updates. It is of note that the OpenVPN advisory tracked as CVE-2020-15078 does not affect the provided version 2.4.11, but the security audit will falsely flag it as vulnerable because the source of the audit is FreeBSD where OpenVPN was migrated to 2.5 series already.

[Write Better Firewall Rules in OPNsense using Aliases](https://homenetworkguy.com/how-to/write-better-firewall-rules-opnsense-using-aliases/?utm_source=bsdweekly): When you first learned to write firewall rules in OPNsense, you may have simply used the pre-defined aliases for the network interfaces/ports and IP addresses such as “LAN net”, “LAN interface”, “HTTP”, “HTTPS”, etc. You may not have even realized you were using aliases since they do not appear in the list on the “Aliases” page. Using the predefined aliases is not only convenient but helps make your rules easier to understand (imagine having a large number of rules and seeing only IP/network addresses).
