## Tutorials

[How to convert from ports-jail to /jails/freshports](https://news.freshports.org/2021/08/14/how-to-convert-from-ports-jail-to-jails-freshports/?utm_source=bsdweekly): This post is the latest in a series of posts documenting the process of converting from using a chroot to using a full proper jail.

[The Power To Serve: Custom Kernel Goodness on FreeBSD](http://www.nxfury.com/the-power-to-serve-custom-kernel-goodness-on-freebsd?utm_source=bsdweekly): Like Linux, FreeBSD (and Windows and MacOS) all have an underlying Kernel. This is basically a loose term that describes all the underlying components that the user doesn't see day-to-day when utilizing an Operating System, such as firmware and drivers being loaded, support for multithreading, filesystem support, and so on. Because BSD has so much support for strange devices- like VAX machines of old- it's expected of users who wish to optimize their systems to purge unneeded support from their system.
