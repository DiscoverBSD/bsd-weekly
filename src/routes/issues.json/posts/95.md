[NetBSD Project Report: Add support for chdir(2) support in posix_spawn(3) ](https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/project_report_add_support_for?utm_source=bsdweekly): The primary goal of the project was to extend posix_spawn(3) to include chdir(2) for the newly created child process. Two functions were supposed to be implemented, namely posix_spawn_file_actions_addchdir() and posix_spawn_file_actions_addfchdir(), to support both chdir(2) and fchdir(2) respectively. posix_spawn() is a POSIX standard method responsible for creating and executing new child processes.
