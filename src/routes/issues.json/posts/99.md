This survey helps the project to understand who that community is and how the project is being used. The results of this survey will help prioritize platform compatibility and gather feedback regarding what they're doing well and where they can improve. Feedback from this survey is anonymous.

There are lots of ways FreeBSD is not Linux or vice versa. Or ways they're actually better for some purposes. Just ask Netflix. In a lively hour of conversation, Goodkin visits many operating systems and related topics regarding the open source world as well as FreeBSD.

[FreeBSD Foundation Soliciting Project Proposals](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-announce-freebsd-foundation-soliciting-project-proposals?utm_source=bsdweekly): The FreeBSD Foundation is soliciting the submission of project proposals for funded development. Successful completion of many of the contributed ideas such as Raspberry Pi hardware improvements, support for the exFat filesystem, and adding Capsicum use in more applications would be beneficial for the Project and have clear deliverables. However, please do not feel limited to these topics. We welcome proposals with other ideas for improving the base system, the ports tree, documentation, or other areas. If you think your proposal will benefit the Project, we will consider it.
