Finally, the installer hanging at the cleaning stage for ZFS installation got fixed, and OpenRC and dhcpcd were removed from the base code. Furthermore, automation configuration for HD 7000 series and older GPUs has been added. Also added was the support for os-release to show GhostBSD name and GhostBSD version in applications like mate-system-monitor, python distros, pfetch, and neofetch and added a new set of wallpapers for 2022 and removed p7zip from the default selection since it is vulnerable and unmaintained.

## News

["The early days of Unix at Bell Labs" - Brian Kernighan (LCA 2022 Online)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECCr_KFl41E&utm_source=bsdweekly): In barely 50 years, the Unix operating system has gone from a tiny two-⁠person experiment in a New Jersey attic to a multi-⁠billion dollar industry whose products and services are an integral part of the world's computing infrastructure. Along the way, there have been many changes, but a surprisingly large amount is much the same as when it started. How did this come about? What are the good ideas in Unix that have been preserved and even spread? What are the good ideas that have fallen by the wayside? What are the not so good ideas that have prospered? And what might the future hold?

## Tutorials

[Local authoritative DNS on OpenBSD using dhcpd(8) and unbound(8)](https://amissing.link/local-authoritative-dns.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): One meaningful addition to home networks is the ability to refer to devices using domain names instead of IP addresses. Domain names are more memorable and human readable. Local authoritative DNS allows things like this to work
