[OpenBSD Errata: January 24, 2022 (ppctrap)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-january-24-2022-ppctrap?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for macppc kernel trap handler have been released for OpenBSD 6.9 and 7.0.

[OpenBSD Errata: January 19, 2022 (libexpat vmm)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-january-19-2022-libexpat-vmm?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for expat XML library have been released for OpenBSD 6.9 and 7.0. Errata patch for kernel vmm has been released for OpenBSD 7.0. Binary updates for the amd64, i386 and arm64 platform are available via the syspatch utility.

[Note: two files changed and hashes/signatures updated for NetBSD 8.1](https://bsdsec.net/articles/note-two-files-changed-and-hashes-signatures-updated-for-netbsd-8-1?utm_source=bsdweekly): The NetBSD release engineering team recently received a notification that for the (very old) NetBSD 8.1 release there was a checksum mismatch on our ftp server. This was not the effect of some hack, but incomplete manual fixes to a manual mistake made during the initial release of NetBSD 8.1. To make sure nothing bad happened, they recreated the two affected images from scratch in internal trusted build environment and replaced the files on the ftp server.

[Why we're migrating (many of) our servers from Linux to FreeBSD](https://it-notes.dragas.net/2022/01/24/why-were-migrating-many-of-our-servers-from-linux-to-freebsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Some time ago they started a complex, continuous and not always linear operation, that is to migrate, where possible, most of the servers (theirs and of their customers) from Linux to FreeBSD. The reasons are many, and this article lists some of them with corresponding explanations.

[ Cluster provisioning with Nomad and Pot on FreeBSD](https://klarasystems.com/articles/cluster-provisioning-with-nomad-and-pot-on-freebsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Many modern production environments are built on top of Docker and Kubernetes. It is common to see READMEs for open source tools offering build options for the docker crowd and sometimes tools only support docker based workflows. This is a natural product of the reality that many developer workflows are built on top of Docker â€“ when you already know a tool, it makes sense to also use it in your other projects.
