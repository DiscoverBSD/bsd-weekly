## News

[iwx(4) gains 11ac 80MHz channel support](https://www.undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20220315070043&utm_source=bsdweekly): Following a request-for-testing thread on tech@, Stefan Sperling (stsp@) has committed some IEEE 802.11ac support to iwx(4). This makes it possible to use 80MHz channels and VHT-specific MCS. Other 11ac features remain disabled for now.

[BSD Now 445: Journey to BSD ](https://www.bsdnow.tv/445?utm_source=bsdweekly): Idiot's guide to OpenBSD on the Pinebook Pro, FreeBSD Periodic Scripts, history of service management in Unix, journey from macOS to FreeBSD, Unix processes “infecting” each other, navidrom music server on FreeBSD, and more.

[mtw(4), a driver for MediaTek MT7601U Wi-Fi devices](https://www.undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20220310135156&utm_source=bsdweekly): James Hastings (hastings@) has committed mtw(4), a driver for MediaTek MT7601U USB Wi-Fi devices.

## Tutorials

[Optimizing FreeBSD Power Consumption on Modern Intel Laptops](https://www.neelc.org/posts/optimize-freebsd-for-intel-tigerlake/?utm_source=bsdweekly): One thing with FreeBSD is that unlike Windows or desktop Linux, the default configuration is poorly optimized for laptops that are newer than your ancient ThinkPad T420, or maybe a T460s. Therefore there are a few things to keep in mind.

[Making RockPro64 a NetBSD Server](https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/making_rockpro64_a_netbsd_server?utm_source=bsdweekly): There are some minor issues with the RockPro64. It has no ability to use ECC memory. It only comes with 1 PCIe 4x slot, and Rockchip errata limited this to PCIe 1.x. It is possible to use a PCIe bridge to enable more devices for booting, or to enable both a network and storage device.
