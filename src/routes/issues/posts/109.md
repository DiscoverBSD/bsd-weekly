[Syspatch retracted (OpenBSD Errata: April 22, 2022 (wifi))](https://bsdsec.net/articles/syspatch-retracted-openbsd-errata-april-22-2022-wifi?utm_source=bsdweekly): Syspatch syspatch71-001_wifi has been retracted. A mistake was made in generating the syspatch(8) binary update syspatch71-001_wifi for this errata. This causes problems installing future binary updates and reverting the syspatch. Because of this, the syspatch has been retracted until the issue is resolved. The actual source patch is not affected from this (and can be applied as described in the patch instructions) and the syspatch itself works fine as well. If you already have installed the syspatch71-001_wifi update, you can continue running with it until we publish instructions on how to recover on http://www.openbsd.org/errata71.html.

[OpenBSD Errata: April 22, 2022 (wifi)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-april-22-2022-wifi?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patch for wireless drivers in the kernel has been released for OpenBSD 7.1. Binary updates for the amd64, i386 and arm64 platform are available via the syspatch utility.
