[Writing my first OpenBSD game using Godot](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2022-04-28-writing-a-game-with-godot.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): Solène Rapenne: a few days ago I discovered the open source game engine Godot.

[compiling an openbsd kernel 50% faster](https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/compiling-an-openbsd-kernel-50-faster?utm_source=bsdweekly): Ted Unangst: My theory is that compiling less code will be faster than compiling more code, but first we must find the code so we know not to compile it. The OpenBSD kernel source tree has a total of 6.93M lines and 383.41M bytes of code...

First though, I need to determine its latency, and the benchmark tool available to me, dd, measures throughput not latency.
