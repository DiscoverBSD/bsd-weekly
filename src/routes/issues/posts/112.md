## Tutorials

[How to Install cgit With Gitolite and Nginx on FreeBSD 13](https://herrbischoff.com/2021/10/how-to-install-cgit-with-gitolite-and-nginx-on-freebsd-13/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Recently, I dove into creating a very simple Git server setup, gradually moving away from the big Git providers. First I used Gitea for some time but (unsurprisingly) realized that I like editing text files in the terminal a lot more than clicking around web sites. So I did embark on the mission of setting up a robust but simple Git server solution. Along the way I encountered a couple of not particularly well-documented trip wires, so this document attempts to do that, in a small way.
