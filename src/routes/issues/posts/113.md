[Hotfix GhostBSD 22.06.18 ISO is now available](http://ghostbsd.org/22.06.18_iso_is_now_available?utm_source=bsdweekly): This new ISO contains a critical fix and software updates. The last change to automount was untested, and the live iso was automating all internal drives and caused serious partitioning issues and installation problems.

[GhostBSD 22.06.15 ISO is now available](http://ghostbsd.org/22.06.15_iso_is_now_available?utm_source=bsdweekly): It contains many bug fixes, security fixes, feature improvements, software updates, and OS updates. For details, see the changelog on the link.

## Tutorials

[Differences between base and ports LLVM in OpenBSD](https://www.cambus.net/differences-between-base-and-ports-llvm-in-openbsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Frederic Cambus: Base vs ports LLVM in OpenBSD, and why we still need both

[Using Netgraph for FreeBSD’s Bhyve Networking](https://klarasystems.com/articles/using-netgraph-for-freebsds-bhyve-networking/?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD 13 adds new support for a netgraph backend for virtual network devices under bhyve. Netgraph is a modular networking framework that allows for arbitrary stacking of protocols and transports, along with filtering, tunneling, redirection, inspection, injection and more—fast and feature-rich, netgraph is to networking what the geom layer is to disks and storage. This article provides a basic recipe to demonstrate some common netgraph syntax and use-cases.Why might you want to run CURRENT? If you have a large modified code base, or are building a product based on FreeBSD, CURRENT gives you a look into the future of FreeBSD. Running CURRENT will help you understand changes that are happening in the FreeBSD Operating System and it gives you an opportunity to see how your stack performs with new features. In this article we will show how to build a CURRENT system with the debugging features disabled, and perform some benchmarks to test the impact debugging features have on performance.
