## Releases

[NetBSD 9.3 released](http://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/netbsd_9_3_released?utm_source=bsdweekly): The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce NetBSD 9.3, the third release from the NetBSD 9 stable branch. It represents a selected subset of fixes deemed important for security or stability reasons since the release of NetBSD 9.2 in May 2021, as well some enhancements backported from the development branch. It is fully compatible with NetBSD 9.0. Users running 9.2 or an earlier release are strongly recommended to upgrade. Aside from many bug fixes, 9.3 includes backported improvements to suspend and resume support, various minor additions of new hardware to existing device drivers, compatibility with UDF file systems created on Windows 10, enhanced support for newer Intel Gigabit Ethernet chipsets, better support for new Intel and AMD Zen 3 chipsets, support for configuring connections to Wi-Fi networks using sysinst(8), support for wsfb-based X11 servers on the Commodore Amiga, and minor performance improvements for the Xen hypervisor.

[Ada development on FreeBSD 13.1](https://blog.vacs.fr/vacs/blogs/post.html?post=2022%2F08%2F05%2FAda-on-FreeBSD-13.1&utm_source=bsdweekly): The Ada support has been removed from FreeBSD 13.1 ports because it was deprecated. Indeed, the gcc6-aux port was deprecated and expired on 2022-02-28. There is no indication about a replacement solution and using Ada for FreeBSD is a challenge but this is still possible. This article records a number of steps and commands that helped me setup a new Ada compiler based on GCC 12 on a fresh FreeBSD 13.1 installation.
