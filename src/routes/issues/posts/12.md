## Google Summer of Code

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school.

[Students can register](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/student-signup/) and submit their applications to mentor organizations until  March 31, 2020 at 20:00 (Central European Summer Time). As almost every year (or every single one of them?), BSDs are there as well, so if you know a student that could be interested, let them know!

Searchable list of [all organizations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/?sp-page=2) is available.

We were able to find these BSD projects:
- [FreeBSD](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5674592867188736/)
- [NetBSD](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5125029991284736/)

But there are many other interesting projects that help BSD community like Wine, LLVM, different databases and much more!  

## Releases

[New FuryBSD 12.1 based images are available for XFCE, and KDE](https://www.furybsd.org/new-furybsd-12-1-based-images-are-available-for-xfce-and-kde/?utm_source=bsdweekly). This new release is now based on FreeBSD 12.1 with the latest FreeBSD quarterly packages. This brings XFCE up to 4.14, and KDE up to 5.17. In addition to updates this new ISO mostly addresses community bugs, community enhancement requests, and community pull requests. Due to the overwhelming amount of reports with GitHub hosting all new releases are now being pushed to SourceForge only for the time being. Previous releases will still be kept for archive purposes.

The os108 project is one of the few (or only?) distributions based on NetBSD currently providing a MATE-based desktop experience atop this BSD. [The os108 9.0 release is now available](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=os108-NetBSD-9.0-Desktop&utm_source=bsdweekly) that re-bases against the recent NetBSD 9.0 release while continuing to provide its out-of-the-box desktop goodness.

[XIGMANAS 12.1.0.4 Ingva Released](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xigmanas/files/XigmaNAS-12.1.0.4/12.1.0.4.7382/?utm_source=bsdweekly). This build has been upgraded to FreeBSD 12.1-RELEASE P3 and brings updates to many packages. It is not recommended to perform an in-place upgrade via the firmware update page because of recent changes to the partition layout with a revision older than 6625.

## News

TrueNAS 12.0 CORE, which up until the new TrueNAS / FreeNAS branding unification would have been called FreeNAS, will in its next release support ZFS async copy-on-write functionality. iXsystems' Kris Moore announced last week that the [ZFS asynchronous copy-on-write](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=TrueNAS-12-ZFS-Async-CoW&utm_source=bsdweekly) support has landed in the TrueNAS CORE 12.0 snapshots.

[NomadBSD now have a forum](https://forum.nomadbsd.org) for you to look for help and give them feedback.

[The FreeBSD Community day that was intended to be held on March 29 has been cancelled due to COVID-19](https://wiki.freebsd.org/DevSummit/202004?utm_source=bsdweekly). There are plans to host the event November 1. More details about this will be posted as we get closer to the event.

On March 4, members of the Foundation team and FreeBSD Community headed to Pasadena, California for a packed agenda of [FreeBSD activities at SCALE x18](https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/blog/scale-18x-conference-recap/?utm_source=bsdweekly). In the end, SCALE was, yet again, another successful advocacy effort to encourage more people to use and contribute to FreeBSD.

As previously announced, on February 29, 2020 FreeBSD removed GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) version 4.2.1 from the base system. Although GCC has not been used by default for anything in FreeBSD-current / svn head for some time before this commit, this milestone marks the completion of a major [journey to modernize the FreeBSD toolchain](https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/blog/project-update-toolchain-modernization/?utm_source=bsdweekly). The purpose of this blog is to provide detail about the motivation, scope, and timeline for this initiative.

## Tutorials

[FreeBSD ZFS on Root Migration](https://antranigv.am/weblog_en/posts/freebsd-zor-migration/?utm_source=bsdweekly): a simple how-to guide for migrating a FreeBSD system from one machine to another.

[The FreeBSD-linuxulator explained (for users)](https://www.leidinger.net/blog/2010/09/28/the-freebsd-linuxulator-explained-for-users/?utm_source=bsdweekly): After another mail where the author explained a little bit of the linuxulator behavior, they decided it is time to try to make an easy text which they can reference in future answers.

[How to set up vsftpd on FreeBSD 12?](https://www.osradar.com/how-to-set-up-vsftpd-on-freebsd-12/?utm_source=bsdweekly) An FTP server, although for many it can be a bit old-fashioned, is quite useful. Especially in computer networks where you need to share files internally. Or even if we are in a house with several computers, it would also be useful. Best of all, it is still easy to set up one and more on FreeBSD 12. So in this post, you will learn how to set up vsftpd on FreeBSD 12.

In this video, we are going to see [an overview of FuryBSD 12.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0DnCmZfQd4&utm_source=bsdweekly) and some of the applications pre-installed.
