[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-22:13.zlib](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-22-13-zlib?utm_source=bsdweekly): Applications that call inflateGetHeader may be vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Note that inflateGetHeader is not used by anything in the FreeBSD base system, but may be used by third party software.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-22:20.tzdata](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-22-20-tzdata?utm_source=bsdweekly): Several changes to future and past timestamps have been recorded in the IANA Time Zone Database after previous FreeBSD releases were released. This affects many users in different parts of the world. Because of these changes, the data in the zoneinfo files need to be updated. If the local timezone on the running system is affected, tzsetup(8) needs to be run to update /etc/localtime.

## Tutorials

[New FreeBSD Quick Guide: Video Playback on FreeBSD](https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/new-freebsd-quick-guide-video-playback-on-freebsd-quick-guide/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Setting up basic video playback on FreeBSD is quick and simple! In this guide, we’ll download and set up the xine video player on a fresh FreeBSD install. The xine multimedia player relies on the XWindow system and the XVideo extension to provide a graphical video playback interface.

[ Writing FreeBSD Kernel Modules in Rust](https://research.nccgroup.com/2022/08/31/writing-freebsd-kernel-modules-in-rust/?utm_source=bsdweekly): At present all major operating system kernels are written in C/C++, languages which provide no or minimal assistance in avoiding common security problems. Modern languages such as Rust provide better security guarantees by default and prevent many of the common classes of memory safety security bugs. In this post we will take a brief look at existing community efforts towards this goal and build a basic “Hello World” proof-of-concept kernel module for FreeBSD.
