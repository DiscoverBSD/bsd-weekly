[NetBSD Security Advisory 2022-004: procfs(5) missing permission checks](https://bsdsec.net/articles/netbsd-security-advisory-2022-004-procfs-5-missing-permission-checks?utm_source=bsdweekly): Due to missing permission checks it was possible to reuse open descriptors which are exposed in the procfs(5) pid /fd/ directory. It might allow malicious user to bypass permission checks and read data from opened descriptor under some circumstances.

[NetBSD Security Advisory 2022-003: Race condition in mail.local(8)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/netbsd-security-advisory-2022-003-race-condition-in-mail-local-8?utm_source=bsdweekly): A race condition exists in the mail.local(8) (/usr/libexec/mail.local) program which is setuid root. That may be exploited in order to change the ownership of or append arbitrary data to an arbitrary file. A malicious local user may exploit the race condition to acquire write permissions to a critical system file, and leverage the situation to acquire escalated privileges. This was originally addressed in NetBSD-SA2016-006 and has been assigned CVE-2016-6253. The fix proved inefficient and had to be fixed again, which is the reason for this new advisory.

[NetBSD Security Advisory 2022-002: Coredump credential reference count leak](https://bsdsec.net/articles/netbsd-security-advisory-2022-002-coredump-credential-reference-count-leak-507c4286-27cb-43af-97ac-7a32c94aca55?utm_source=bsdweekly): The coredump handling code always leaks a reference to the dumped processes cred structure. An attacker may cause the reference count to overflow, leading to a use after free (UAF).
