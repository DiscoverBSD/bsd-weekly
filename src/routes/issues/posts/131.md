[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-22:14.heimdal [REVISED]](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-22-14-heimdal-revised?utm_source=bsdweekly): Multiple security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Heimdal implementation of the Kerberos 5 network authentication protocols and KDC. - - CVE-2022-42898 PAC parse integer overflows - - CVE-2022-3437 Overflows and non-constant time leaks in DES{,3} and arcfour - - CVE-2021-44758 NULL dereference DoS in SPNEGO acceptors - - CVE-2022-44640 Heimdal KDC: invalid free in ASN.1 codec - - CVE-2019-14870 Validate client attributes in protocol-transition - - CVE-2019-14870 Apply forwardable policy in protocol-transition - - CVE-2019-14870 Always lookup impersonate client in DB

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-22:28.heimdal](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-22-28-heimdal?utm_source=bsdweekly): The patch released with FreeBSD-SA-22:14.heimdal included an inadvertently merged block of code which prevents the KDC from issuing valid tickets.

[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-22:15.ping](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-22-15-ping?utm_source=bsdweekly): ping reads raw IP packets from the network to process responses in the pr_pack() function. As part of processing a response ping has to reconstruct the IP header, the ICMP header and if present a "quoted packet," which represents the packet that generated an ICMP error. The quoted packet again has an IP header and an ICMP header. The pr_pack() copies received IP and ICMP headers into stack buffers for further processing. In so doing, it fails to take into account the possible presence of IP option headers following the IP header in either the response or the quoted packet. When IP options are present, pr_pack() overflows the destination buffer by up to 40 bytes.

## News

[Help the OpenBSD Foundation Reach Its 2022 Funding Goal](https://www.undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20221202062601&utm_source=bsdweekly): The OpenBSD Foundation, which is central to funding the OpenBSD project, needs your help to reach its 2022 Fundraising Goal of $300,000. At the time of writing, the amount raised in 2022 stands at a little over 50% of the stated goal.

## Tutorials

[ Authentication gateway with SSH on OpenBSD](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2022-12-01-openbsd-authpf.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): A neat feature in OpenBSD is the program authpf, an authenticating gateway using SSH. Basically, it allows to dynamically configure the local firewall PF by connecting/disconnecting into a user account over SSH, either to toggle an IP into a table or rules through a PF anchor.

[Running OpenZFS – Choosing Between FreeBSD and Linux](https://klarasystems.com/articles/running-openzfs-choosing-between-freebsd-and-linux/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Age-old discussion: ZFS running on Linux or FreeBSD? We're not going to set out to tell you which operating system you should use. Both choices are excellent — but we’ll lay out how different (or alike) it is to run OpenZFS on either to help anyone on the fence decide which OS to use beneath our favorite filesystem.
