## Releases

[NetBSD 10.0 BETA available](http://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/netbsd_10_0_beta_available?utm_source=bsdweekly): After nearly 3 whole years of development (work started on NetBSD 10 in late 2019), BETA snapshots have finally been published for interested users to test. More changes will be backported from the development branch over the next few months before we tag a final release, so the BETA images will keep getting updated. Among the features you can expect to find in NetBSD 10 are reworked cryptography, including compatibility with WireGuardⓇ, automatic swap encryption, new disk encryption methods, and CPU acceleration in the kernel. In hardware support, there are updated GPU drivers from Linux 5.6, support for more ARM hardware (including Rockchip RK356X, NXP i.MX 8M, Amlogic G12¸ Apple M1, and Raspberry Pi 4), support for new security features found in the latest ARM CPUs, and support for Realtek 2.5 gigabit and new Intel 10/25/40 gigabit ethernet adapters. compat_linux has been ported to AArch64 and DTrace has been ported to MIPS. For retrocomputing enthusiasts, there's improved multiprocessor support on Alpha, and more iMac G5 support. The Xen hypervisor support has received a major rework. There are various new userspace programs, including blkdiscard(8) to manually TRIM a disk, aiomixer(1) to control audio volume, realpath(1), and fsck_udf(8). And loads more...

## News

[FreeBSD Foundation Sponsors Update to WireGuard Kernel Port for FreeBSD ](https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/foundation-sponsors-update-to-wireguard-kernel-port-for-freebsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): WireGuard’s simplicity makes it an elegant VPN solution. This general-purpose VPN tunnel is fast and lean, and provides a good alternative to existing tools like IPsec and OpenVPN. An updated version for FreeBSD ships out-of-the-box in the next release, thanks to the Foundation’s support. 

[FreeBSD 2022 in Review: Advocacy ](https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/2022-in-review-advocacy/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Yet another year is coming to an end and we’re taking a look back at how we advocated for FreeBSD over the past year. 2022 started with a bit of uncertainty, but thankfully has ended with a bit of a return to “normal” whatever that means. Through it all, the Foundation staff continued to work together to expand the ways to spread the word about FreeBSD. Take a look at what they’ve been doing for the past year.
