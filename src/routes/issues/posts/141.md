## Releases

[OPNsense 23.1.1 released](https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=32484.0&utm_source=bsdweekly): Apart from security updates for operating system and third party software this mainly fixes issues with the initial 23.1 release. IPsec and Unbound components in particular receive a number of improvements being the more prominent areas of work for this series. Unbound also gained a SafeSearch option and the new reporting database CPU usage should be much lower and easier to use.

[FreeBSD Security Advisory FreeBSD-SA-23:02.openssh](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-security-advisory-freebsd-sa-23-02-openssh?utm_source=bsdweekly): A flaw in the backwards-compatibility key exchange route allows a pointer to be freed twice. A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to cause a denial of service, or possibly remote code execution. Note that FreeBSD 12.3 and FreeBSD 13.1 include older versions of OpenSSH, and are not affected. FreeBSD 13.2-BETA1 and later include the fix.
