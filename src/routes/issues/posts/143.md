Yet another RC for FreeBSD 13.2 plus MidnightBSD 3.0. What a week!

<!-- more -->

## Releases

[MidnightBSD 3.0 release](https://www.midnightbsd.org/notes/?utm_source=bsdweekly): A few key updates include import of many FreeBSD 12.x features, OpenSSL 1.1.1s and many third party software updates. Anyone using MidnightBSD for internet facing services that's not using openssl from mports already should update as soon as possible. Warning: the current packages available for both amd64 and i386 include an outdated version of mesa that is not playing nice with various web browsers that make use of EGL. They've updated mesa in mports but haven't been able to rebuild packages yet. This could be a blocker for desktop users until packages are refreshed. Most GUI browsers aren't working with the packages, although text browsers are available. They plan to update the packages this week. You can update mesa from mports and downstream ports that use it if you don't want to wait for packages.

[FreeBSD 13.2-RC5 Available](https://www.freebsd.org/news/newsflash/#2023-03-27:1?utm_source=bsdweekly): The fifth RC build for the FreeBSD 13.2 release cycle is now available. ISO images for the amd64, i386, powerpc, powerpc64, powerpc64le, powerpcspe, armv6, armv7, aarch64, and riscv64 architectures are FreeBSD mirror sites.

[FreeBSD or Linux – A Choice Without OS Wars](https://klarasystems.com/articles/choosing-between-freebsd-and-linux-a-choice-without-os-wars/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Pinning FreeBSD against Linux is a tale as old as time. But it removes from the necessary conversation about which technology is most suitable for its users. Both Linux and FreeBSD are mature operating systems with a myriad of resources and features to offer. At times, one will be more suitable than the other depending on the use case and aim. In this article, we take time to discuss where does it fit, and provide the audience with more reading material before making a decision.

Nowadays, the standard protocols regarding those subjects are CalDAV and CardDAV.

It relies on PHP and is available as a package on OpenBSD.

These facilities are critical components of the modern digital economy, but they also consume vast amounts of energy. In fact, datacenters are estimated to account for around 1% of global electricity consumption, and that figure is projected to grow as digital technologies continue to expand.
