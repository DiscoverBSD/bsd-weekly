## Releases

[GhostBSD 23.06.01 ISO is now available](https://ghostbsd.org/23.06.01_iso_is_now_available?utm_source=bsdweekly): This release contains a new tool called Backup Station to manage ZFS boot environment. Now the default time is set to local instead of UTC, which fixes an issue with LightDM time. Software Station search got improved to be less laggy.

[OPNsense 23.1.9 released](https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=34282.0&utm_source=bsdweekly): A small update to improve stability with multiple delegated prefixes from DHCPv6 connectivity as well as proper "no binding" handling in the DHCPv6 client itself. Internally, the backend service has been refactored to allow for future additions, but no visible functionality changes have been done.
