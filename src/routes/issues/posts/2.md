There were also new development branch installation ISOs available for FreeBSD and pkgsrc-2019Q4 is out as well. Read on to learn more about all BSD from last week and for links to the videos from bhyvecon Tokyo 2019.

## The second most reliable hosting company site in December 2019 runs FreeBSD

Linux was the most popular operating system in December 2019, used by eight of the [top 10 most reliable hosting company sites](https://news.netcraft.com/archives/2020/01/02/most-reliable-hosting-company-sites-in-december-2019.html?utm_source=bsdweekly). FreeBSD appears in second place with New York Internet and SmartOS makes an appearance in ninth place with EveryCity.

Netcraft measures and makes available the response times of around twenty leading hosting providers' sites. The performance measurements are made at fifteen minute intervals from separate points around the internet, and averages are calculated over the immediately preceding 24 hour period.

## Releases

[New FreeBSD development branch installation ISOs](https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/snapshots/ISO-IMAGES/?utm_source=bsdweekly) and virtual machine disk images have been uploaded to the FreeBSD Project mirrors. Read specifics about [stable/11](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-snapshots/2020-January/000643.html), [stable/12](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-snapshots/2020-January/000642.html) and [current/13](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-snapshots/2020-January/000641.html). As with any development branch, the installation snapshots are not intended for use on production systems. Testing on non-production systems is encouraged as much as possible.

The pkgsrc developers are proud to announce the 65th quarterly release of pkgsrc, [pkgsrc-2019Q4](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-users/2020/01/06/msg030130.html?utm_source=bsdweekly), the cross-platform packaging system. pkgsrc is available with more than 20,000 packages, running on 23 separate platforms.

## News

[i915 DRM has been updated](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/2019/12/31/23972.html?utm_source=bsdweekly) to match the Linux 4.8.17 version, in DragonFly BSD. It includes some OpenBSD work too, interestingly. There’s also [a refresh of the iwm(4) driver](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/2020/01/03/23989.html?utm_source=bsdweekly) in DragonFly, which will apparently help most for iwm-9000 and iwm-9260 owners. Also, [mrouted(8) is being removed](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/2019/12/31/23972.html?utm_source=bsdweekly) from DragonFly – but it’s available as a port if you need it.

Tom Smyth writes about [an interview he did with Theo de Raadt](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20191231214356&utm_source=bsdweekly) in between g2k19, the general hackathon in Ottawa, and BSDCAN 2019.

If you use the GeoIP functionality of pfBlockerNG or if you use the "IP Reputation" component of pfBlockerNG or if you want to continue to see the Country for IP blocked events in the Reports Tab, then [you must register for a free MaxMind account](https://forum.netgate.com/topic/149343/pfblockerng-maxmind-registration-required-to-continue-to-use-the-geoip-functionality?utm_source=bsdweekly) and obtain a License key.

Is it possible to run [a virtualized FreeNAS server inside a ProxMox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1smyTOlB4M&utm_source=bsdweekly) (open-source platform for enterprise virtualization), giving you the best of both worlds? Well, not only does it work, this build is insanely fast and quiet, making it quite possibly the perfect home server.

[BSD Notizie](https://bsdnotizie.blogspot.com/2020/01/gruppi-bsd-in-italia.html?utm_source=bsdweekly) created a list of different BSD groups in Italy.

Do you want to run Nextcloud in FreeBSD? Read [this guide](https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2020/01/04/nextcloud-17-on-freebsd-12-1/?utm_source=bsdweekly) that covers how to run Nextcloud 17 with FreeBSD 12.1.  

There's a new tool in works for fans of bhyve: [Runhyve](https://runhyve.app/?utm_source=bsdweekly) is a virtual machines and virtual networks manager for FreeBSD+bhyve. Runhyve consists of two parts: hypervisor and web application - panel. To build hypervisor we chose software like FreeBSD, ZFS, vm-bhyve, nginx. Panel is powered by Elixir and Phoenix.

[Heads up for pkgsrc users](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-users/2020/01/05/msg030124.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): the Wayland option is now turned on by default for NetBSD 9 and Linux in cases where it peacefully coexists with X11. Right now, this effects the following packages: `graphics/MesaLib`, `devel/SDL2`, `www/webkit-gtk`, `x11/gtk3`. The WebRTC option has also been enabled by default on NetBSD 9 for two Firefox versions: `www/firefox`, `www/firefox68`.

If you are keen on attending next year’s EuroBSDcon conference and require financial support, please consider applying for [Paul Schenkeveld Travel Grant](https://lists.eurobsdcon.org/pipermail/announce/2019-November/000006.html?utm_source=bsdweekly) by [filling out the contact form](https://eurobsdconfoundation.org/contact/) before January 21st 2020, stating who you are, what you are doing with BSD, and why you should receive the grant. The EuroBSDcon Foundation board will consider all valid submissions in its sole discretion and communicate its selection by February 1st 2019.

### More

As always, there are more sources of BSD goodness. Latest [BSD Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJRe2mbHuVI&utm_source=bsdweekly) talks about How learning OpenBSD makes computers suck a little less, How Unix works, FreeBSD 12.1 Runs Well on Ryzen Threadripper 3970X, BSDCan CFP, HardenedBSD Infrastructure Goals, and more.

The Valuable News weekly series is dedicated to providing summary about news, articles and other interesting stuff mostly but not always related to the UNIX or BSD systems. The latest is from [2020-01-06](https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2020/01/06/valuable-news-2020-01-06/?utm_source=bsdweekly).
