## Announcing FreeBSD Fridays: A Series of 101 Classes  

Beginning on July 17, we hope you’ll join FreeBSD Foundation for an expanded #FreeBSDFridays series of 101 classes. They’re building on the FreeBSD Day content to offer 1 hour live sessions every Friday, designed to get you started with FreeBSD. The program kicks off with Deb Goodkin’s Intro to FreeBSD class, followed by a two-part Installfest led by Roller Angel. The sessions will take place at 10am PDT at[ https://live.freebsd.org/FreeBSD/freebsdfriday/](https://live.freebsd.org/FreeBSD/freebsdfriday/)

Other classes include, Introduction to OpenZFS by Dan Langille, A Brief History of the BSD Fast Filesystem by Kirk McKusick, and more.

## Releases

Seems to be none.

## BSDSec

[End of support for NetBSD 7](https://bsdsec.net/articles/end-of-support-for-netbsd-7?utm_source=bsdweekly): Earlier, the EOL date for NetBSD 7 was extended to June 30, 2020, to accommodate people who could not update machines due to pandemic restrictions. Thus as of July 1, 2020, there will be no further maintenance to the NetBSD 7 branches (netbsd-7, netbsd-7-1 and netbsd-7-0). We recommend all users still running these ancient releases to test the latest 9.0_STABLE versions and update as soon as possible.

[pkgsrc-2020Q2 released](https://bsdsec.net/articles/pkgsrc-2020q2-released): The pkgsrc developers are proud to announce the 67th quarterly release of pkgsrc, the cross-platform packaging system.  pkgsrc is available with more than 22,000 packages, running on 23 separate platforms; more information on pkgsrc itself is available at https://www.pkgsrc.org/.

[Virtual Bug Squash, Saturday 11th July 1400-2100UTC](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-announce-virtual-bug-squash-saturday-11th-july-1400-2100utc). On the 11th July 2020 from 1400-2100 UTC FreeBSD will be running a coordinated virtual Bug Squash. FreeBSD has a Problem Report (PR) database where users and developers are encouraged to file issues and regressions they find in both the base system and ports tree. A Bug Squash is a focused session where we try to triage, process, fix and close as many reports as we can from the PR database.

[Command Line Bug Hunting in FreeBSD](https://adventurist.me/posts/00301?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD uses bugzilla for tracking bugs, taking feature requests, regressions and issues in the Operating System. The web interface for bugzilla is okay, but if you want to do a lot of batch operations it is slow to deal with. There is a plan to run a bugsquash in July and that really needs some tooling to help any hackers that show up process the giant bug list project has. Thankfully there is a python3 command line tool for interacting with bugzilla, called pybugz. bugz allows you to search through, up date and modify bugs without having to use a web browser.
