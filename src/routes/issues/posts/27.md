## [Core Team Office Hours](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-announce-core-team-office-hours?utm_source=bsdweekly)  

FreeBSD recently held an election for its governing body called the Core Team (results in News section).

The newly elected Core Team would like to invite you to a virtual town hall meeting. They'll be holding two sessions, one timed well for Europe and the Americas; the other timed well for Asia, Africa and India. Sessions will be held at 1800 UTC on July 7, 2020 and 0200 UTC on July 8, 2020. See [https://wiki.freebsd.org/OfficeHours](https://wiki.freebsd.org/OfficeHours) for details on how to join either a live stream to watch, or an interactive meeting to participate. A link to this agenda (and any updates) will be there as well.

They'll be discussing the chosen topics and taking general questions at the end. They'll have a moderator who will help call on people in the meeting to ask questions (or to offer comments) as well as relay relevant questions from IRC.

## Releases

The release of [NomadBSD 1.3.2 is now available](http://nomadbsd.org/index.html#1.3.2?utm_source=bsdweekly), base system has been upgraded to FreeBSD 12.1-p6. Many new utils has been added, like `brightness_listener`, `load_iichid`, `volumecontrol` and more. NomadBSD is a persistent live system for USB flash drives, based on FreeBSD.

[TrueNAS 12 Beta 1 Released With Much Improved ZFS, Better AMD Ryzen CPU Support](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=TrueNAS-12.0-Beta-1-Released&utm_source=bsdweekly):   As what was formerly FreeNAS, the first beta of TrueNAS CORE 12.0 is available for testing of this BSD-based operating system for NAS devices and other storage setups. The TrueNAS 12.0 Beta 1 both for the CORE and Enterprise editions includes much improved ZFS support with now relying upon the code that's going to be released as OpenZFS 2.0, support for ZFS async copy-on-write, native ZFS dataset encryption, ZFS user quota capabilities, and more. In addition to much improved ZFS support there is also better hardware support with improved AMD Ryzen support as well as expanded network card coverage being two areas. TrueNAS 12.0 Beta 1 also brings a wide variety of performance improvements, support for fusion pools, API keys for scripted control of TrueNAS, and other changes.

[OPNsense 20.1.8 released](https://opnsense.org/opnsense-20-1-8-released/?utm_source=bsdweekly): OPNsense was delayed while they chased a race condition in the updates back to an issue with the latest FreeBSD package manager updates. For now they reverted to our current version but all relevant third party packages have been updated as updates became available over the last weeks, e.g. cURL and Python, and hostapd / wpa_supplicant amongst others.

## News

[First powerpc64 snapshots available for OpenBSD](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20200707001113&utm_source=bsdweekly): Since we reported the first bits of powerpc64 support going into the tree on 16 May, work has progressed at a steady pace, resulting in snapshots now being available for this platform. So, if you have a POWER8 system idling around, go to your nearest mirror and fetch a snapshot. Keep in mind that as this is still very early days, very little handholding is available - you are basically on your own.
