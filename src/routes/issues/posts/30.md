## Releases

Seems top be none.

## BSDSec

[OpenBSD Errata: July 22nd, 2020 (tty)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-july-22nd-2020-tty?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for the kernel have been released for OpenBSD 6.6 and 6.7. Only pty devices need reprint delays. Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility. As these affect the kernel, a reboot will be needed after patching.

[OpenBSD Errata: July 27th, 2020 (rpki)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-july-27th-2020-rpki?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for rpki-client have been released for OpenBSD 6.7. In rpki-client, incorrect use of EVPPKEYcmp allows an authentication bypass. Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility.

[OpenBSD Errata: July 27th, 2020 (iked)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-july-27th-2020-iked?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for OpenIKED have been released for OpenBSD 6.6 and 6.7. In iked, incorrect use of EVPPKEYcmp allows an authentication bypass. Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility.

## News

[New ext2fs support for DragonFly](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/2020/07/27/24780.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): Tomohiro Kusumi has imported a new version of ext2 filesystem support into DragonFly.

[FreeBSD Core Team 10 in Review](https://www.freebsdfoundation.org/blog/freebsd-core-team-10-in-review/?utm_source=bsdweekly): As Core Team 11 readies to take over management of the FreeBSD Project, FreeBSD Foundation interviewed members of Core Team 10 for their observations on a productive two years.

[NetBSD Is Making Progress On Benchmarking For Performance/Regression Testing](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NetBSD-Benchmark-Progress-1&utm_source=bsdweekly): One of many interesting Google Summer of Code 2020 projects is working on automated benchmarking for NetBSD in order to allow for performance/regression testing of this BSD operating system known for its portability across CPU architectures.

[DragonFlyBSD Updates Its Intel + Radeon Linux-Ported Graphics Driver Code](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=DragonFlyBSD-DRM-4.12.14-Port&utm_source=bsdweekly): As of this weekend the code is now up to a state matching Linux 4.12.14. Yes, still quite old with Linux 5.8 around the corner, but at least progress is being made and it's better than in the past or where there was no driver support previously.

[nvi2 in FreeBSD ports](https://rubenerd.com/nvi2-in-freebsd-ports-and-pkgsrc/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Craig Leres on the FreeBSD ports team has deprecated nvi-devel in lieu of nvi2, with the former expiring this time in October.

## Tutorials

[Adding Networking to the 2.11BSD pl 195 system](https://bsdimp.blogspot.com/2020/07/adding-networking-to-211bsd-pl-195.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): These instructions are for FreeBSD, alas, and other system may differ. However, the first section is the only part that's FreeBSD specific. In the same series, there's also another article: [First screen shot of 2.11BSD as released](https://bsdimp.blogspot.com/2020/07/first-screen-shot-of-211bsd-as-released.html?utm_source=bsdweekly).

[ZFS High Availability Filesystem With minio on FreeBSD](https://honeyguide.eu/posts/minio-fuse/?utm_source=bsdweekly): minio on FreeBSD can easily be used as storage platform to add High Availability and Scale Out features to ZFS or FFS.

[When Unix learned to reboot(2)](https://bsdimp.blogspot.com/2020/07/when-unix-learned-to-reboot2.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): Recently, a friend of this author asked about the history of halt, and when did we have to stop with the sync / sync / sync dance before running halt or reboot. The two are related, it turns out.

[FreeBSD 64bit Assembler (amd64)](https://honeyguide.eu/posts/asm64-fbsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): For FreeBSD, there are not many 64bit assembler (amd64) examples available on the web and virtually none that are a little bit more complex. To change this, author ported a DOS Tetris game to 64bit FreeBSD, using SVGALIB to max VGA out with 320x200 and 256 colours - it is 2020 after all!
