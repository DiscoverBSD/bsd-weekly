## Releases

[OPNsense 20.7.2 Released](https://opnsense.org/opnsense-20-7-2-released/?utm_source=bsdweekly): While team is still looking closer at netmap/iflib performance on 12.1, they are rolling out a kernel with Intel em/igb updates that should avoid bad packet counts in the default installation. Syslog-ng received a workaround for the diagnosed startup issue and alias now supports MAC address content similar to how host content works.

[MidnightBSD 1.2.8](http://www.justjournal.com/users/mbsd?utm_source=bsdweekly): There was a security issue in dhclient. They've created new ISOs for 1.2.8 for those installing from scratch. If you are on 1.2.7, you can simply update the source from git for stable/1.2 branch and rebuild dhclient.

## BSDSec

[5 new FreeBSD Security Announcements and Errata notices](https://bsdsec.net/tags/freebsd?utm_source=bsdweekly): There have been 5 new Security Announcements and Errata notices for FreeBSD. They concern `linuxthread`, `ipv6`, `sctp`, `getfsstat` and `dhclient`.

Following FreeBSD, there are [multiple advisories affecting MidnightBSD 1.2.x and current](https://bsdsec.net/articles/midnightbsd-security-multiple-advisories?utm_source=bsdweekly).

[OpenBSD Errata: September 5th, 2020 (`amdgpu`)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-september-5th-2020-amdgpu?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for the kernel have been released for OpenBSD 6.6 and 6.7. A buffer overflow was discovered in an amdgpu ioctl. Binary updates for the amd64 and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility. As these affect the kernel, a reboot will be needed after patching.

## News

[CVE-2020-7460: FreeBSD Kernel Privilege Escalation](https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2020/9/1/cve-2020-7460-freebsd-kernel-privilege-escalation?utm_source=bsdweekly): In August, an update to FreeBSD was released to address a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) bug that could be exploited by an unprivileged malicious userspace program for privilege escalation. This vulnerability was reported to the ZDI program by a researcher who goes by the name m00nbsd. He has graciously provided this write-up and proof-of-concept code detailing ZDI-20-949/CVE-2020-7460.

[bhyve: The FreeBSD Hypervisor](https://klarasystems.com/articles/bhyve-the-freebsd-hypervisor/?utm_source=bsdweekly): bhyve was originally designed and implemented by Neel Natu, and a small team at NetApp grew the functionality over time. This project was eventually shelved, but the code was open sourced and contributed to FreeBSD in May of 2011. After that, it has seen continuous development ever since.

## Tutorials

[What FreeBSD can offer you that other operating systems does not?](https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2020/09/07/quare-freebsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly) This post is not here to convince you to use or try FreeBSD – this you will have to do by yourself. This article will show you why FreeBSD is valuable or better alternative to other operating systems and is definitely not dying.

[Find which package provides a given file in OpenBSD](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2020-09-04-pkglocate-openbsd.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): There is one very hand package on OpenBSD and it’s pkglocatedb which provides the command pkglocate. If you need to find a file or binary/program and you don’t know which package contains it, use pkglocate.
