## Releases  

[MidnightBSD 1.2.9 RELEASE](https://bsdsec.net/articles/midnightbsd-security-midnightbsd-1-2-9-release?utm_source=bsdweekly) is now available in git in the stable/1.2 branch. It addresses two security vulnerabilities in `bhyve` and one in `ftpd`. Additionally, 2.0-CURRENT includes a fix for an issue with `ure(4)`.

There is the first release candidate [TrueNAS 12.0-RC1](https://www.truenas.com/docs/hub/intro/release-notes/tn-12_0-rc1/?utm_source=bsdweekly) for the first unified FreeNAS and TrueNAS release, renamed to TrueNAS CORE and TrueNAS Enterprise, respectively. More than 180 bugs have been fixed since 12.0-BETA2 as final polishing continues toward the launch of 12.0-RELEASE in October.

The [second BETA build for the FreeBSD 12.2](https://www.freebsd.org/news/newsflash.html#event20200918:01?utm_source=bsdweekly) release cycle is now available. ISO images for the amd64, armv6, armv7, arm64, i386, powerpc, powerpc64, powerpcspe, and sparc64 architectures are available on most of the FreeBSD mirror sites.

## News

[OpenZFS 2.0-RC2 Released With Dozens Of Fixes](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OpenZFS-2.0-RC2-Released&utm_source=bsdweekly): OpenZFS 2.0 is a huge update for this open-source ZFS file-system implementation in that it mainlines FreeBSD support alongside Linux, there is Zstd compression support, many performance optimizations, fast clone deletion, sequential resilvering, and a lot of other improvements and new features.

New version of [FreeBSD Instant-workstation 2020](https://euroquis.nl//freebsd/2020/09/17/instant-workstation.html?utm_source=bsdweekly) is out. The script is slightly longer and more involved now, comparing to year ago when it was published first.

- Support for more operating environments has landed
- Support for application installations has landed
- VMWare support was submitted
- SDDM / polkit configuration has been introduced so you can shutdown / reboot from inside the KDE Plasma environment via the Leave menu

[Why FreeBSD is moving to git](https://bsdimp.blogspot.com/2020/09/freebsd-subversion-to-git-migration.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): Warner talks about the reasons behind the planned move to git from subversion. This article focuses on the technical reasons that the previous core team decided to migrate the project from Subversion to git. Future articles will cover the nuts and bolts of what changes to people's work flows can be expected.

There is also a [video](https://youtu.be/Lx9lKr_M-DI?utm_source=bsdweekly) talking about the same topic.

[DragonFly BSD offers first-boot tool](https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20200921#news&utm_source=bsdweekly): People who wish to customize the DragonFly BSD operating system have a new tool on their workbench. The project has introduced a first-boot flag which allows a program or script to be run once, and only once, the first time the operating system is booted following installation. "You can now add something to run on first boot after install, only, on DragonFly. This is probably of most use to you if you are building a custom image."
