[DragonFly 5.8.2 released](http://lists.dragonflybsd.org/pipermail/users/2020-September/381422.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): New bugfix releases for 5.8 DragonFly series has been released.

Description: udf: Validate the full file entry length Otherwise a corrupted file entry containing invalid extended attribute lengths or allocation descriptor lengths can trigger an overflow when the file entry is loaded.

## BSDSec

None last week.

As always, it's worth following [BSDSec](https://bsdsec.net). [RSS feed](https://bsdsec.net/articles.atom) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/bsdsec) available.

## News

[Podcast: Security Headlines with Mischa Peters](https://blog.firosolutions.com/2020/09/security-headlines-mischa-peters/?utm_source=bsdweekly). In this episode, we interview Mischa Peters which is a long time BSD user with a background in the world of data centers and ISP’s. One of his latest projects is OpenBSD Amsterdam which is a pure-hearted OpenBSD virtual machine hosting provider. That is running 100% OpenBSD, it’s even using OpenBSD’s own hypervisor. We deep dive into OpenBSD Amsterdam, scripting with ssh, awk, and the basic tools, BSD, Hack-tic and a lot more.

[Unified pfSense® Documentation](https://www.netgate.com/blog/introducing-the-new-unified-pfsense-documentation.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): To improve the documentation for pfSense® software and make it easier to use, Netgate are merging the content from the book and the former wiki into a single unified set of documentation available now at [https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/).

[Default window manager switched to CTWM in NetBSD-current](https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/default_window_manager_switched_to?utm_source=bsdweekly): For more than 20 years, NetBSD has shipped X11 with the "classic" default window manager of twm. However, it's been showing its age for a long time now.

[Nix package manager in FreeBSD](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports?view=revision&revision=550026&utm_source=bsdweekly): Nix is a purely functional package manager. This means that it treats packages like values in purely functional programming languages such as Haskell -- they are built by functions that don't have side-effects, and they never change after they have been built. FreeBSD support in Nix is not fully complete yet. This commit only brings the Nix package manager to the ports. Hopefully, this port will streamline the work of bootstrapping of Nix packages on FreeBSD.

There is [new FreeBSD channel on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/J4GPTGz?utm_source=bsdweekly). Looks like it is not the official one.

##  k2k20 hackathon reports

OpenBSD had another hackathon and some reports are in:
- [Martijn van Duren on snmp, agentx, and other progress](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20200920073933&utm_source=bsdweekly)
- [k2k20 hackathon report: Bob Beck on LibreSSL progress](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20200921105847&utm_source=bsdweekly)
- [k2k20 hackathon report: Klemens Nanni on network land decluttering](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20200921110059&utm_source=bsdweekly)
- [k2k20 hackathon report: Rafael Sadowski on KDE and other packages progress](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20200925112030&utm_source=bsdweekly)

## NetBSD Google Summer of Code

Final reports from GSoC are in as well:
- [RumpKernel Syscall Fuzzing](https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/google_summer_of_code_20201?utm_source=bsdweekly)  
- [Curses Library Automated Testing](https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/google_summer_of_code_2020?utm_source=bsdweekly)

## Tutorials

[A simple shell status bar for OpenBSD and cwm(1)](https://www.tumfatig.net/20200923/a-simple-shell-status-bar-for-cwm/?utm_source=bsdweekly): This article is about using cwm and termbar together. The idea behind termbar is to launch an terminal that will loop printing the information you want; via a shell script.

[How to configure a small mail server](https://www.bsdhowto.ch/mxpop3.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): This post is about setting up a mail server on an Internet facing host. It will accept and send mails for a domain, store the accepted mails locally and deliver them using POP3. This is a rather lengthy post because there are quite some pieces to put together. OpenSMTPD will handle incoming and outgoing mail using SMTP. rspamd will support it in fighting incoming spam and malware (using ClamAV), and signing outgoing mail using DKIM. Dovecot stores received mail for users and deliver it using POP3. Finally acme-client(8) is used to manage the certificate from Let's Encrypt.

[Relayd in OpenBSD](https://puffy.nolink.ch/posts/relayd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): One of the components of OpenBSD is `relayd`. It’s an integrated Loadbalancer & Proxy Service, like F5, Nginx and Others. But just like other BSD Services, straight, simple and easy to use.
