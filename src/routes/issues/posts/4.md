## To BSD, or not to BSD  

Last week brought a bit of controversy on different community websites, after article called "[Why you should migrate everything from Linux to BSD](https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/why-you-should-migrate-everything-from-linux-to-bsd.html?utm_source=discoverbsd)" has been shared around. It is a *opinionated* blog post discussing Linux problems and presenting reasons to switch to BSD.

There is an interesting response "[Should you migrate from Linux to BSD? It depends](https://fediverse.blog/~/AllGoodThings/should-you-migrate-from-linux-to-bsd-it-depends?utm_source=discoverbsd)". While author agrees, that there may be reasons to migrate to BSD, they think, that mentioned article lists the wrong reasons. Then they take a look at the points, one by one.

## BSDSec

Errata patches for the kernel [have been released for OpenBSD 6.5 and 6.6](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-january-17th-2020-inteldrmctx?utm_source=discoverbsd). Execution Unit state was not cleared on context switch with Intel Gen9 graphics hardware. Binary updates for the amd64 and i386 platforms are available via the syspatch utility. Source code patches can be found on the respective errata page: [https://www.openbsd.org/errata65.html](https://www.openbsd.org/errata65.html) and [https://www.openbsd.org/errata66.html](https://www.openbsd.org/errata66.html). As these affect the kernel, a reboot will be needed after patching.

## News

[The first report](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20200120173020&utm_source=discoverbsd) from the just concluded u2k20 hackathon (OpenBSD) comes from Alexandr Nedvedicky (sashan@).

With the relaunch of a certification for BSD professionals, the Linux Professional Institute wants to help support and raise awareness of the BSD projects. Watch the talk ["LPI and BSD Working Together" by G Matthew Rice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QItb5aoj7Oc&utm_source=discoverbsd) (from LCA 2020) and learn what's next for this undertaking and share your ideas in how LPI can make it valuable to the free software community.

Deb Goodkin and the FreeBSD Foundation graciously organised and chaired a dedicated FreeBSD miniconf at the long-running linux.conf.au event held each year in a different city in Australia and New Zealand. This [the first FreeBSD conference in Australia](https://rubenerd.com/the-first-freebsd-conference-in-australia/?utm_source=discoverbsd). Videos from the event [are available](https://papers.freebsd.org/2020/linux.conf.au/?utm_source=discoverbsd) as well.

There's a new [server for BSDs on Discord](https://discord.gg/u6GK8DY?utm_source=discoverbsd). Discord itself doesn't seems to have a client version for BSD, but you can use browser or mobile version of their app.

### Tutorials

A FEMP stack, which is akin to a LEMP stack on Linux, is a collection of open-source software that is typically installed together to enable a FreeBSD server to host dynamic websites and web applications. FEMP is an acronym that stands for FreeBSD (operating system), Nginx (HTTP server), MySQL (database server), and PHP (programming language to process dynamic PHP content). In this [tutorial](https://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-setup-femp-stack-nginx-mysql-php-on-freebsd-12/?utm_source=discoverbsd), we'll set up components of a FEMP stack on a FreeBSD 12.1 server using `pkg`, the FreeBSD package manager.

Last week, we have talked about why `syslog-ng` is the perfect solution for [the central log host of FreeBSD based infrastructure](https://blog.socruel.nu/freebsd/a-central-log-host-with-syslog-ng-on-freebsd.html?utm_source=bsdweekly). Today, we can learn how to run `syslog-ng` in jail with help of [BastilleBSD](https://www.syslog-ng.com/community/b/blog/posts/running-syslog-ng-in-bastillebsd?utm_source=discoverbsd). There is even more simple way using a prepared [template](https://gitlab.com/bastillebsd-templates/syslog-ng).

Planning to upgrade FreeBSD from 11.3 to 12.1? There is [a set of notes](https://blog.bimajority.org/2020/01/13/upgrading-freebsd-from-11-3-to-12-1/?utm_source=discoverbsd) while cranking through upgrading about 30 machines from 11.3 to 12.1 since they are not specific and this process isn't very well documented.

ZFS pools can be made with a single disk, then turned into a mirror after the fact by [adding additional drives](https://rubenerd.com/making-a-zfs-mirror-from-an-existing-pool/?utm_source=discoverbsd). This is especially useful for staging or homelabs, where you might not have the money upfront to buy both drives, or want to test it before spending time resilvering.

FreshPorts runs on a FreeBSD server which hosts multiple jails. Two of these jails run PostgreSQL server. When [upgrading from one version of PostgreSQL to another](https://dan.langille.org/2020/01/20/migrating-freshports-from-one-db-server-to-another/?utm_source=discoverbsd), they run `pg_dump` in the new jail, and load the backup into that database server. Learn step by step how they do this process.

WireGuard is quickly gaining popularity in the VPN marketplace due to its speed, simplicity, and modern cryptography standards. Starting with FreeNAS version 11.3-RC1, it is possible to [connect your NAS directly to a WireGuard network](https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/wireguard-on-freenas-11-3/?utm_source=discoverbsd) with a few easy steps.

Forgot Swap? With this quick video tutorial you can learn how to [add a Swap to your FreeBSD install](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjQlI-C2dBo&utm_source=discoverbsd).
