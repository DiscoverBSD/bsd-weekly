## OpenZFS Developer Summit 2020

The eighth annual OpenZFS Developer Summit was an online conference which took place Oct 6-7 (Tue-Wed) over Zoom.

[FreeBSD under VMware ESXi on Arm Fling](https://vincerants.com/freebsd-under-vmware-esxi-on-arm-fling/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Earlier this week, VMware released ESXi on Arm Fling, their hypervisor for the ARM platform. Here are instructions to get a FreeBSD virtual machine up and running under VMWare ESXi on Arm Fling. These instruction assume you’ve followed VMware’s documentation on setting up the hypervisor on your ARM platform, and are familiar with the basics of how ESXi/vSphere functions.

This page is to document my findings with various bits of hardware, and if possible, list fixes.
