[NetBSD Security Advisory 2020-003: USB network interface jumbo packets](https://bsdsec.net/articles/netbsd-security-advisory-2020-003-usb-network-interface-jumbo-packets?utm_source=bsdweekly): Some USB network interface drivers are missing a bounds check, without which data from the network may be copied past the end of an array allocated in a kernel mbuf cluster. This enables a network device on the same LAN to corrupt kernel memory. The affected USB network interfaces are: atu(4), axe(4), axen(4), otus(4), run(4), ure(4).
