## Releases

[NetBSD 9.1 available](https://bsdsec.net/articles/netbsd-9-1-available?utm_source=bsdweekly):The NetBSD Project is pleased to announce NetBSD 9.1, the first feature and stability update for the netbsd-9 release branch. Over the last months many changes have been made to the NetBSD 9 stable branch. As a stable branch the release engineering team and the NetBSD developers are conservative with changes to this branch and many users rely on the binaries from our regular auto-builds for production use. The new release features (among various other changes) many bug fixes, a few performance enhancements, stability improvements for ZFS and LFS and support for USB security keys in a mode easily usable in Firefox and other applications. For more details and instructions see the 9.1 announcement at [https://www.NetBSD.org/releases/formal-9/NetBSD-9.1.html](https://www.NetBSD.org/releases/formal-9/NetBSD-9.1.html)

[TrueNAS 12.0 RELEASE](https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/truenas-12-0-is-released/?utm_source=bsdweekly) was made available, and with it, TrueNAS CORE and TrueNAS Enterprise are now ready for production deployments. The merger of FreeNAS and TrueNAS into a unified software image is now officially complete and has become a production-ready platform right on schedule.

[OPNsense 20.7.4 released](https://opnsense.org/opnsense-20-7-4-released/?utm_source=bsdweekly): This release finally wraps up the recent Netmap kernel changes and tests. The Realtek vendor driver was updated as well as third party software cURL, libxml2, OpenSSL, PHP, Suricata, Syslog-ng and Unbound just to name a couple of them.

## Tutorials

[ext4 (and FUSE) on FreeBSD](https://euroquis.nl/freebsd/2020/10/26/fuse.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD has a FUSE kernel module, which allows it to use other filesystems – in user space – than it would normally do.

[Running 9front on OpenBSD vmd](https://armeye.github.io/posts/p9obsd.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): OpenBSD 6.8 was just released, and it included a few fixes to vmd that allows us to run 9front without crashing.

I will not describe the install process of the base OpenBSD as it is basically quite simple process. Users need to just follow the install wizard ans ask questions. Focus on a specific way of using OpenBSD and the configuration of this system for the laptop.
