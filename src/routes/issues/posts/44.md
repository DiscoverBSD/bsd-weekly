The FreeBSD Azure Release Engineering Team is pleased to announce the availability of FreeBSD 12.2-RELEASE on Microsoft Azure Marketplace: [https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/thefreebsdfoundation.freebsd-12_2](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/thefreebsdfoundation.freebsd-12_2).


## BSDSec

[OpenBSD Errata: November 5th, 2020 (wg)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-november-5th-2020-wg?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for the kernel have been released for OpenBSD 6.8. wg(4) could panic the kernel by releasing the wrong lock. Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility. As these affect the kernel, a reboot will be needed after patching.


[OpenBSD Errata: November 10th, 2020 (unwind)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-november-10th-2020-unwind?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for unwind have been released for OpenBSD 6.7 and 6.8. unwind fails to process large DNS replies. Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility.

[OpenBSD Errata: November 10th, 2020 (rpki)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-november-10th-2020-rpki?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for rpki-client have been released for OpenBSD 6.7 and 6.8. rpki-client incorrectly checks the manifest validity interval. Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility.

## News

[Firefox is not paxctl safe for NetBSD](https://anonhg.netbsd.org/pkgsrc/rev/9386adbd052e?utm_source=bsdweekly): This has been tested on amd64. Hopefully other architectures don't have additional ways to be not-mprotect-safe, but there is always the possibility. No obvious performance difference in an older (non-wasm) javascript benchmark.

[OpenBGPD 6.8p1 released](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbgpd-6-8p1-released?utm_source=bsdweekly): This is the second stable release for the 6.8 version. It includes the following change: Include OpenBSD 6.8 errata 001: In bgpd, the roa-set parser could leak memory. OpenBGPD-portable is known to compile and run on FreeBSD, and the Linux distributions Debian, Ubuntu and Alpine Linux.
