[OpenBSD Errata: December 1st, 2020 (xmaplen)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-december-1st-2020-xmaplen?utm_source=bsdweekly) Errata patches for the X server have been released for OpenBSD 6.7 and 6.8. Multiple input validation failures in the X server XKB extension can lead to out of bounds memory accesses for authorized clients. Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility.

## News

> This issue of BSD Weekly was brought to you by `intro(1)`.

[History of FreeBSD – Part 3: Early Days of FreeBSD](https://klarasystems.com/articles/history-of-freebsd-part-3-early-days-of-freebsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): In this third part of our series on the history of FreeBSD, we start tracing the early days of FreeBSD and the events that would eventually shape the project and the future of open source software.


## Tutorials

[A mesh VPN using OpenBSD and WireGuard](https://www.tumfatig.net/20201202/a-mesh-vpn-using-openbsd-and-wireguard/?utm_source=bsdweekly): WireGuard is a new coming to OpenBSD 6.8 and it looks like a simple and efficient way to connect computers. Author has a few VPS that tend to be connected through filtered public services and/or SSH tunnels. And that’s neither efficient nor easy to manage.

[Wireguard Puffy to OPNsense](https://puffy.nolink.ch/posts/wireguard_opnsense/?utm_source=bsdweekly): How to Setup an WG Tunnel between OpenBSD and OPNSense?

[Webinar: Best Practices For Optimizing ZFS](https://klarasystems.com/learning/webinars/best-practices-for-optimizing-zfs1/?utm_source=bsdweekly): ZFS was introduced in 2001 to make storage administration easier by combining the filesystem with the volume manager, introducing new levels of redundancy, and a much simpler user interface, ZFS works for most common use cases out-of-the-box, but to get the most out of it requires understanding what it is doing, and how each of the tuning knobs impacts it. During the first webinar in the “Best Practices for ZFS” series, Allan has touched on the following topics:

- Building Your Storage Array – Everything from picking the best hardware to RAID-Z and using mirrors.
- Keeping up with Data Growth – Expanding and growing your pool, and of course, shrinking with device evacuation.
- Datasets and Properties – Controlling settings with properties and many other tricks!
