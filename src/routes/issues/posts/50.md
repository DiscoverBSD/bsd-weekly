[OpenBSD Errata: December 24th, 2020 (smtpd)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-december-24th-2020-smtpd?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for smtpd have been released for OpenBSD 6.7 and 6.8. smtpd's filter state machine can prematurely release resources leading to a crash. Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility.

[FreeBSD 2020 in Review: Advocacy](https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/2020-in-review-advocacy/?utm_source=bsdweekly): It’s that time again. We’re looking back at how Foundation advocated for FreeBSD over the past year. They began the year like any other with many in-person events on the horizon, celebrations planned for our upcoming 20th anniversary and energy that comes with introducing new people and companies to FreeBSD. Then March rolled around, and well, you know rest. Thankfully, the Foundation team has been able to work together on new and expanded ways to spread the word about FreeBSD.

[Multi-volume support in HAMMER2](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/2020/12/28/25287.html) If you remember HAMMER1’s ability to create a volume that spanned multiple local disks, that capability’s been introduced to HAMMER2.  Look at the commit message to see how it works so far. Note that this is not multi-master replication.


## Tutorials

[Virtualize Your Network on FreeBSD with VNET](https://klarasystems.com/articles/virtualize-your-network-on-freebsd-with-vnet/?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD Jails are a well-known feature and have become core to many excellent tools on FreeBSD such as the Poudriere package builder. Jails offer process and file system isolation, but for a long time they did not offer very satisfying network isolation. VIMAGE provides isolation for networking through virtual network stacks or VNET.
