## [helloSystem: The “Less is More” FreeBSD Desktop](https://www.freebsdnews.com/2020/12/30/hellosystem-the-less-is-more-freebsd-desktop/?utm_source=bsdweekly)  

helloSystem is a FreeBSD desktop OS that focuses on simplicity, elegance, and usability. It boots quickly and provides a responsive desktop experience with a mere 20 running processes. helloSystem draws on the Lumina and FuryBSD desktop projects for its archive and WiFi utilities, plus its LiveCD infrastructure.

[A video tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=PlPTVbhrKYM) is available of a helloSystem preview build.

## Tutorials

[Setup ssh-chat, an interesting SSHd-based chat server on OpenBSD](https://ozgur.kazancci.com/setup-ssh-chat-an-sshd-based-chat-server-on-openbsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): In this article, Özgür Kazanççı talks about ssh-chat (by Andrey Petrov) and installs it step-by-step on OpenBSD. `ssh-chat` is a very interesting instant messaging chat daemon/SSH server, written in Go. Connecting to the port it listens, instead of a shell, you get a fancy, retro, IRC-like chat prompt.

[BastilleBSD Native Container Management for FreeBSD](https://fibric.hashnode.dev/bastillebsd-native-container-management-for-freebsd?utm_source=bsdweekly): BastilleBSD is very promising. Practically negligible performance differences, active development, smart features (templates), and excellent documentation and guides are worth a recommendation.
