## Releases

[OPNsense 20.7.8 released](https://forum.opnsense.org/index.php?topic=20984.0): The particular volume of this stable update foreshadows the end of the 20.7 series in less than two weeks. One longstanding issue with radvd on FreeBSD 12.1 has been resolved according to multiple user feedback. Also, the mailing lists have been archived and will no longer be used. Consumers of the development version are now able to upgrade to 21.1-RC1.

[GhostBSD 21.01.20 release note](https://ghostbsd.org/21.01.20_release_notes?utm_source=bsdweekly): This new release is to fix a bug found in the installer related to the hostname not behind set up properly on the new system installation.

[XigmaNAS 12.2.0.4](https://distrowatch.com/11136?utm_source=bsdweekly) Michael Zoon has announced the release of XigmaNAS 12.2.0.4, a new stable snapshot of the project's embedded, open-source NAS (Network-Attached Storage) distribution based on FreeBSD. This is major update and the first released built on top of FreeBSD 12.2

## News

> This issue of BSD Weekly was brought to you by [FreeBSD handbook](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/)

[OpenBSD KDE Status Report](https://www.sizeofvoid.org/posts/2021-01-23-openbsd-kde-status-report/?utm_source=bsdweekly): OpenBSD has managed to drop KDE3 and KDE4 in the 6.8 -> 6.9 release cycle. This of course brings questions: Kde Plasma 5 package missing. After half a year of work,Qt5 stack has been now updated to the last LTS version 5.15.2.

[WireGuard Is Now Available For pfSense](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=WireGuard-pfSense-Introduced&utm_source=bsdweekly): The domination of the open-source WireGuard secure VPN tunnel not only on Linux systems but BSDs too... WireGuard is now available on pfSense, the FreeBSD-based firewall/router focused software platform. Those that transition to the pfSense 2.5 development snapshots this week can begin enjoying the WireGuard support, which like all of the other features can be controlled via the pfSense web interface with setting up new WG interfaces. The updated pfSense sources are also available.

[ujoy(4) added to OpenBSD -current](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20210123115934&utm_source=bsdweekly): Thomas Frohwein (thfr@) added a joystick/gamecontroller driver to -current. This includes ujoyhidiscollection() to work around limitations of hidis_collection() until this can be combined without fallout.

## Tutorials

[Calibrate your touch-screen on OpenBSD](https://www.tumfatig.net/20210122/calibrate-your-touch-screen-on-openbsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): T460s comes with a touch-screen. It is recognized by default on OpenBSD and not well calibrated as-is. But thatâ€™s really simple to solve.
