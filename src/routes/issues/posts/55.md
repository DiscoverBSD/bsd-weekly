## News

[BREAKING pf(4) change: change route-to so it sends packets to IPs instead of interfaces](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20210201231420&utm_source=bsdweekly): Does your pf configuration have route-to rules? If so, you need to consider the implications of this commit by David Gwynne (dlg@) carefully: change route-to so it sends packets to IPs instead of interfaces. The intention is to make it as easy as nat/rdr to use, and more robust when it's operating.

[FreeBSD/i386 demoted to Tier 2 for FreeBSD 13.x](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-announce-freebsd-i386-demoted-to-tier-2-for-freebsd-13-x?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD is designating i386 as a Tier 2 architecture starting with FreeBSD 13.0. The Project will continue to provide release images, binary updates, and pre-built packages for the 13.x branch. However, i386-specific issues (including SAs) may not be addressed in 13.x.

## Tutorials

[Simple and Secure VPN in FreeBSD – Introducing WireGuard](https://klarasystems.com/articles/simple-and-secure-vpn-in-freebsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Wireguard is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology that aims to enable the easy deployment and configuration of servers and clients. Wireguard is intended to replace the use of IPSec or OpenVPN for many VPN applications.

[Setup a Three Node Replicated GlusterFS Cluster on FreeBSD](http://www.unibia.com/unibianet/freebsd/setup-three-node-replicated-glusterfs-cluster-freebsd?utm_source=bsdweekly) A technology demonstration and tutorial for running a three node replicated GlusterFS volume on FreeBSD. It uses Bhyve virtual machines as the hosts and ZFS as the underlying filesystem for the brick. The following topics are covered: 1) Initializing the host machine for Bhyve, 2) Creating and starting Bhyve VM's, 3) Deploying and configuring GlusterFS, 4) Setting up clients.

[Annotate your PDF files on OpenBSD](https://www.tumfatig.net/20210126/annotate-your-pdf-files-on-openbsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Annotating (or signing) PDF files is a really simple task using Preview on macOS. You can’t do it on OpenBSD using Zathura, Xpdf etc. But there is a software in the ports that can achieve this: Xournal.

[NetBSD on the EdgeRouter Lite](https://www.cambus.net/netbsd-on-the-edgerouter-lite/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Running the NetBSD/evbmips port on Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite.
