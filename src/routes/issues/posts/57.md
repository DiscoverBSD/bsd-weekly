## News

[FreeBSD CORE Team Office Hours on the 17th of March](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-announce-core-team-office-hours-77872d99-f6b3-45ac-b21e-99fef9306847?utm_source=bsdweekly): Following on from the effort in 2019, The FreeBSD team is arranging another Community Survey to help shape the future of The FreeBSD Project. The purpose of this survey is to collect quantitative data from the public in order to help guide the project's priorities and efforts. Similar surveys have been conducted twice by the FreeBSD Project and we are preparing for our third. Before publishing the next survey the Core Team welcomes you to attend for a Virtual Town Hall meeting to share some of the insights of the 2020 Community Survey, and seek advice on how the next survey should be conducted.

[MidnightBSD Project Status, happy 15th anniversary](https://www.justjournal.com/users/mbsd/entry/33865?utm_source=bsdweekly): MidnightBSD recently added a default .xinitrc file for user profiles to help with the desktop integration on a fresh install. The default desktop environment has recently changed to Xfce. They still need to build packages to get the default on midnightbsd-desktop updated. A number of package bugs are being worked on and they've placed the mport package manager in it's own repository now to help with contributions and allow us to easily package it in mports. February is the 15th anniversary for the project!
