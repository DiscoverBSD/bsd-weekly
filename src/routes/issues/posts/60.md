## Releases

[OPNsense 21.1.3 released](https://opnsense.org/opnsense-21-1-3-released/?utm_source=bsdweekly):  OPNsense movse ahead with the firmware UI and API rework. You will also notice the new plugin conflict dialog which will report that plugins have been installed previously but not registered in the configuration. This can be easily amended by reseting the local conflicts, which essentially accepts the current plugin configuration as the new default.

## BSDSec

[OpenBSD Errata: March 15, 2021 (libssl)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-march-15-2021-libssl?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for LibreSSL have been released for OpenBSD 6.8. A TLS client using session resumption may cause a use-after-free. Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platforms are available via the syspatch utility.

[NetBSD Security Advisory 2021-001: Predictable ID disclosures in IPv4 and IPv6](https://bsdsec.net/articles/netbsd-security-advisory-2021-001-predictable-id-disclosures-in-ipv4-and-ipv6?utm_source=bsdweekly): IP ID randomization was not enabled by default and the randomization algorithms were not strong enough. For all NetBSD versions, you need to obtain fixed kernel sources, rebuild and install the new kernel, and reboot the system.

## News

## Tutorials

[Easy spamAssassin with OpenSMTPD](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2021-03-10-smtpd-spamassassin.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): How to setup very easily the anti-spam SpamAssassin and make it work with the OpenSMTPD mail server (OpenBSD default mail server).

[Customizing the FreeBSD Kernel](https://klarasystems.com/articles/customizing-the-freebsd-kernel/?utm_source=bsdweekly): In this article, we will be looking at the various ways to customize the build of the FreeBSD kernel and its loadable modules. Understanding this process is invaluable for making custom additions or tuning the kernel build for a specific piece of hardware.

[Implement a Command not found handler in OpenBSD](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2021-03-09-openbsd-command-not-found.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): On many Linux systems, there is a special program run by the shell (configured by default) that will tell you which package provide a command you tried to run but is not available in $PATH. Let's do the same for OpenBSD!

## More

As always, there are more sources of BSD goodness. Latest [BSD Now](https://www.bsdnow.tv/393?utm_source=bsdweekly) talks about Lessons learned from a 27 years old UNIX book, Finally dRAID, Setting up a Signal Proxy using FreeBSD, Annotate your PDF files on OpenBSD, Things You Should Do Now, Just: More unixy than Make, and more
