## Tutorials

[Customizing FreeBSD Ports and Packages ](https://klarasystems.com/articles/customizing-freebsd-ports-and-packages/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Without a doubt, one of the most convenient tools of modern open-source operating systems is the package manager. The ability to search, download, and install a wide range of pre-compiled software with only a single command is unparalleled. FreeBSD is no exception here, providing access to binary packages via the pkg(8) utility. However, these packages must all be compiled somewhere, and package consumers are at the mercy of the package producer when it comes to the contents and compile-time options used.

[Upgrading to the new GhostBSD base on 13-STABLE](https://forums.ghostbsd.org/viewtopic.php?f=54&t=1921&utm_source=bsdweekly): Warning: It is safer to backup and reinstalls GhostBSD with an iso. If you follow these steps properly, everything should be fine, but I would backup all the important data in another drive or in a NAS.
