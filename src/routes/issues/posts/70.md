## News

[Valuable News â€“ 2021/05/24](https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2021/05/24/valuable-news-2021-05-24/?utm_source=bsdweekly): The Valuable News weekly series is dedicated to provide summary about news, articles and other interesting stuff mostly but not always related to the UNIX or BSD systems.

[DragonFlyBSD 6.0 Performance Is Looking Great - Initial Benchmarks ](https://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=30191&utm_source=bsdweekly): DragonFlyBSD 6.0 was released recently and while benchmarks of this new DragonFlyBSD release has just begun, the numbers so far are quite compelling for this BSD compared to its prior release.

[BSD Now 403](https://www.bsdnow.tv/403?utm_source=bsdweekly): Why You Should Use BSD Licensing for Your Next Open Source Project or Product, Update on FreeBSD Foundation Investment in Linuxulator, OPNsense 21.1.5 released, FreeBSD meetings on the Desktop, Running FreeBSD jails with containerd 1.5, Markdown, DocBook, and the quest for semantic documentation on NetBSD.org, and more.

[The state of toolchains in OpenBSD](https://www.cambus.net/the-state-of-toolchains-in-openbsd/?utm_source=bsdweekly): For most of the 2010s, the OpenBSD base system has been stuck with GCC 4.2.1. It was released in July 2007, imported into the OpenBSD source tree in October 2009, and became the default compiler on the amd64, i386, hppa, sparc64, socppc and macppc platforms in OpenBSD 4.8, released in November 2010. As specified in the commit message during import, this is the last version released under the GPLv2 license. OpenBSD was not the only operating system sticking to GCC 4.2.1 for licensing reasons, FreeBSD did the same, and Mac OS X as well. Read the article to see what happened next.
## Tutorials

[Getting Started with OpenZFS 2.0](https://klarasystems.com/articles/getting-started-with-openzfs-2-0/?utm_source=bsdweekly): FreeBSD 13.0 imported OpenZFS 2.0 replacing the bespoke port that had served since 2007. The FreeBSD installer has an interface allowing ZFS as the root file system, allowing a bootable FreeBSD system on ZFS. Selecting the guided root on ZFS, install will permit graphical selection of disks to include in a pool. This is an easy way to explore ZFS features without an extensive hardware investment. This article will introduce new users to ZFS, and cover some of the new features in the upgrade.

[How to Run OPNsense in a Proxmox Virtual Machine](https://homenetworkguy.com/how-to/run-opnsense-in-proxmox-vm/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Have you wanted to take a look at OPNsense without installing it to a dedicated machine and/or deploying it as your primary home router/firewall? The easiest way to evaluate OPNsense without installing it on separate hardware is to virtualize it.

[Building Customized FreeBSD Images](https://klarasystems.com/articles/building-customized-freebsd-images/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Did you know that Poudriere is not only a package building tool for FreeBSD, but it can also generate FreeBSD images? You can also use NanoBSD or, perhaps, assemble a bootable FreeBSD image by hand. This article will explore some of the ideas and tools required to start down the path of building customized FreeBSD images, and by the end you should have the knowledge required to continue on your own.

[Potluck & containerd](https://honeyguide.eu/posts/potluck-containerd-poc/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Since containerd 1.5 has arrived in ports a few days ago, we show how you can use runj to easily convert images from the Potluck image library into OCI containers and then run them with containerd.
