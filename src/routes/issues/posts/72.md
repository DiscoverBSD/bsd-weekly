[OpenBSD Errata: June 8, 2021 (cpuswitch inteldrm)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-june-8-2021-cpuswitch-inteldrm?utm_source=bsdweekly): Errata patches for cpuswitch and inteldrm have been released for OpenBSD 6.8 and 6.9. Recent Intel or any AMD machines could crash as the kernel did not flush all TLBs that multi threaded processes require. Disable PPGTT on Intel machines with cherryview/braswell graphics to avoid memory corruption. Binary updates for the amd64 and i386 platform are available via the syspatch utility. As these affect the kernel, a reboot will be needed after patching.

[OpenBGPD 7.0 released](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbgpd-7-0-released?utm_source=bsdweekly): This release includes the following changes to the previous release:

* Stop processing queued UPDATES when the max-prefix limit was reached.
* Improve negotiation for route refresh, graceful restart and multi-protocol capabilities
* Correctly track 'rde evaluate all' and 'export' settings during reload.
* Properly withdraw prefixes when 'rde evaluate all' is used.
* Fix MRT handling on initial startup for message dump types.
* Fix and use non-blocking connect for RTR sessions.
* Fully implement RFC 6286 by checking for BGP ID collisions.
* Adjust the 4-byte AS number handling to RFC 6793 by changing error behaviour from prefix witdraw to attribute discard.
* In bgpctl print out both the sent "Neighbor capabilities" and the "Negotiated capabilities" for a session.
* Print timestamps both as a formatted and a pure time in seconds filed in various JSON objects.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-21:17.libradius](https://bsdsec.net/articles/%0Afreebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-2117libradius?utm_source=bsdweekly): The patch for FreeBSD-SA-21:12.libradius modified rad_get_attr(3) to verify that an attribute length smaller than the minimum required for the attribute type and length fields is disallowed. This check may fail incorrectly for the final attribute in a RADIUS message.

[GearBSD: a project to help automating your OpenBSD](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2021-06-01-gearbsd.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): Author of this post loves NixOS and Guix for their easy system configuration and easy jumping from one machine to another by using your configuration file. To some extent, they want to make it possible to do so on OpenBSD with a collection of parametrized Rex modules, allowing to configure your system piece by piece from templates that you feed with variables.
## Tutorials

[DTrace Network Probes](https://klarasystems.com/articles/dtrace-network-probes/?utm_source=bsdweekly): DTrace landed in FreeBSD 7.1 in 2009. DTrace is an observability framework that enables dynamic tracing of programs, and the FreeBSD Kernel. It offers an incredible view into the operation of programs, and is an excellent tool for debugging and performing analysis of complex software. Using the full power of FDT probes requires familiar knowledge with how things are implemented. SDT probes and specific providers like ip, tcp and udp offer insights into the internal behavior of the kernel without requiring a high level of knowledge of the underlying code.
