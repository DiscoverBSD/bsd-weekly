## [The Evolution of the Unix System Architecture](https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20210618/index.html?utm_source=bsdweekly)

Unix has evolved for more than five decades, shaping modern operating systems, key software technologies, and development practices. Studying the evolution of this remarkable system from an architectural perspective can provide insights on how to manage the growth of large, complex, and long-lived software systems. In 2016 Paris Avgeriou and Diomidis Spinellis embarked on this study aiming to combine software architecture insights and software analytics skills. Here is a brief summary of the study, which was published this month in the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

[OpenBSD Errata: June 25, 2021 (bgpd)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-june-25-2021-bgpd?utm_source=bsdweekly): An errata patch for the bgpd routing daemon has been released for OpenBSD 6.9. During bgpd(8) config reloads prefixes of the wrong address family could leak to peers resulting in session resets. Binary updates for the amd64, i386, and arm64 platform are available via the syspatch utility.

[Akonadi+MySQL 5.7.34 on FreeBSD](https://euroquis.nl/kde/2021/06/27/akonadi.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): Users of Akonadi (databases/akonadi) on FreeBSD are advised of an incompatibility between .. something .. and the current version of MySQL client 5.7. The Akonadi server crashes on startup, and no KDE PIM applications that need Akonadi will work. Users are advised to downgrade the MySQL client libraries for the time being.

[High Availability With OpenBGPD on OpenBSD 6.9](http://kernelpanic.life/software/high-availability-with-openbgpd-on-openbsd.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): Building a simple, highly available web server cluster with OpenBGPD on OpenBSD

[FreeBSD Performance Observability](https://klarasystems.com/articles/freebsd-performance-observability/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Performance observability is a powerful feature that highly supports FreeBSD. In this article, author is showing how to take advantage of tools that are specifically built for and with an operating system: tools which understand and are built into the operating system’s kernel structures. Learn about how to gather the information you need in order to get the most out of your system, determine your operational baselines, and find and resolve performance bottlenecks.
