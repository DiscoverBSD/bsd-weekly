## Releases

[TrueNAS 12.0-U5 Released, FreeNAS Transitions to “Legacy” Status](https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/truenas-12-0-u5-released-freenas-transitions-to-legacy-status/?utm_source=bsdweekly): The migration of FreeNAS to TrueNAS started in October 2020. The transition has been deliberately slow and methodical, while the efficiency gains have been every bit the windfall we anticipated. Over this period, many exabytes of data were carefully managed while the ZFS file system and NAS software were updated with new technologies, features, and performance.
## BSDSec

[OpenBSD Errata: August 4, 2021 (kernel, sparc64)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-august-4-2021-kernel-sparc64?utm_source=bsdweekly): An errata patch for the kernel on the sparc64 architecture has been released for OpenBSD 6.8 and OpenBSD 6.9.

[Low space and HAMMER2 snapshots](https://www.dragonflydigest.com/2021/08/03/26052.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): It used to be that if you had a HAMMER2 volume and ran low on space, snapshotting would stop so that you didn’t completely fill the disk. Now snapshots continue to roll forward and discard older ones to keep disk usage constant. It’s in 6.0 too.
