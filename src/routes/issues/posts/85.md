## News

[Valuable News – 2021/09/20](https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2021/09/20/valuable-news-2021-09-20/?utm_source=bsdweekly): The Valuable News weekly series is dedicated to provide summary about news, articles and other interesting stuff mostly but not always related to the UNIX or BSD systems.

[FreeBSD Technology Roadmap ](https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/technology-roadmap/?utm_source=bsdweekly): Much like any other organization navigating the future during very uncertain times, the FreeBSD Foundation team spent the last year increasingly focused on how best to support its mission and goal – how best to support the FreeBSD Project. They held strategy sessions with the Foundation Board and FreeBSD Core team, reviewed the results of the FreeBSD core team’s user and developer surveys, and held conversations with developers, users and other members of the FreeBSD community to determine where to focus our efforts. The overall goal is to expand and enhance the efforts of the technology team.

[The cgroup filesystem ported to the BSD](https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20210920#news&utm_source=bsdweekly): People who are interested in porting software between open source platforms such as Linux and the members of the BSD family just gained a new tool: a cgroup filesystem for the BSDs. "CGrpFS is a tiny implementation of the GNU/Linux CGroup filesystem for BSD platforms. It takes the form of a FUSE filesystem and implements robust tracking of processes. Resource control, however, is not present; the different BSD platforms each provide different mechanisms for this, none of which are easily adapted to CGroups semantics. The process tracking alone is sufficient for the main user of CGrpFS, InitWare, a service manager derived from systemd." This effort should make it easier to port software from Linux to the members of the BSD family, especially packages which usually rely on systemd.

[OpenZFS 2.1.1 Arrives As A Big Point Release](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=OpenZFS-2.1.1-Released&utm_source=bsdweekly): Following the big OpenZFS 2.1 release from July that brought Distributed SPARE RAID, a compatibility property for pools, and other new features, OpenZFS 2.1.1 is available as a follow-up release for this open-source ZFS file-system implementation for Linux and FreeBSD systems. OpenZFS 2.1.1 has around ninety fixes in this point release making it a rather hearty update from the big v2.1 feature release.

[LibreSSL 3.4.0 Released](https://bsdsec.net/articles/libressl-3-4-0-released?utm_source=bsdweekly): Important new features have been enabled in this release: * Add support for OpenSSL 1.1.1 TLSv1.3 APIs. * Enable the new x509 validator.

[BSD Now 420: OpenBSD makes life better ](https://www.bsdnow.tv/420?utm_source=bsdweekly): Choosing The Right ZFS Pool Layout, changes in OpenBSD that make life better, GhostBSD 21.09.06 ISO's now available, Fair Internet bandwidth management with OpenBSD, NetBSD wifi router project update, NetBSD on the Apple M1, HardenedBSD August Status Report, FreeBSD Journal on Wireless and Desktop, and more.

[ Experimenting with a new OpenBSD development lab](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2021-09-16-experiments-openbsd-building.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): This article is not an how to or explaining anything. Post author just wanted to share how they spend their current free time. It's obviously OpenBSD related.

[EuroBSDCon 2021 Program](https://2021.eurobsdcon.org/about/program/?utm_source=bsdweekly): This weekend the all-online eurobsdcon 2021 is on. It's free, but you need to register in order to join.

[Plasma System Monitor and FreeBSD](https://euroquis.nl//kde/2021/09/15/systemmonitor.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): There’s lots of new code: CPU usage information is all there, CPU monitor widget which can run in the panel or as a separate widget. Networking, processes, memory use – are not there yet.
## Tutorials

[Reuse of OpenBSD packages for trying runtime](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2021-09-19-openbsd-quick-package-work.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): There are always tricks to make bandwidth and storage more efficient, it's not complicated and it's always a good opportunity to understand simple mechanisms available in our daily tools.

[ Benchmarking compilation time with ccache/mfs on OpenBSD](https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2021-09-18-openbsd-ccache-mfs.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): How to make packages building faster. There are at least two easy tricks available: storing temporary data into RAM and caching build objects.

[Using the FreeBSD RACK TCP Stack](https://klarasystems.com/articles/using-the-freebsd-rack-tcp-stack?utm_source=bsdweekly): Did you know that FreeBSD has more than one TCP stack and that TCP stacks are pluggable at run time? Since FreeBSD 12, FreeBSD has support pluggable TCP stacks, and today we will look at the RACK TCP Stack. The FreeBSD RACK stack takes this pluggable TCP feature to an extreme: rather than just swapping the congestion control algorithm, FreeBSD now supports dynamically loading and an entirely separate TCP stack. With the RACK stack loaded, TCP flows can be handled either by the default FreeBSD TCP stack or by the RACK stack.
