By default, top(1) displays the 'top' processes on each system and periodically updates this information every 2.0 seconds using the raw cpu use percentage to rank the processes in the list. This article will give you some insight on how to better understand top (1).

The topic of reverse proxies can be difficult or confusing to understand when you are new to the concept.
