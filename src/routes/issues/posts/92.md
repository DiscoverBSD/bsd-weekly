[OpenBSD Errata: November 9, 2021 (rpki-client)](https://bsdsec.net/articles/openbsd-errata-november-9-2021-rpki-client?utm_source=bsdweekly): An errata patch for rpki-client has been released for OpenBSD 6.9 and OpenBSD 7.0. rpki-client(8) should handle CA misbehaviours as soft-errors. Binary updates for the amd64, i386 and arm64 platform are available via the syspatch utility.

[ FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-21:29.tzdata](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-announce-freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-21-29-tzdata?utm_source=bsdweekly): Several changes in Daylight Saving Time transition dates happened after previous FreeBSD releases were released affecting many users in different parts of the world. Because of these changes, the data in the zoneinfo files need to be updated, and if the local timezone on the running system is affected, tzsetup(8) needs to be run so the /etc/localtime is updated.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-21:28.vmci](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-announce-freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-21-28-vmci?utm_source=bsdweekly): An error during driver initialization results in a kernel panic due to unallocated resources being freed up.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-21:26.libevent](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-announce-freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-21-26-libevent?utm_source=bsdweekly): libevent1 maintains a local copy of some structure definitions from system headers to simplify consumers of the library. One of these structures no longer matched the corresponding system definition, causing inconsistent views of the `struct event` and `struct bufferevent` layouts.

[FreeBSD Errata Notice FreeBSD-EN-21:27.caroot](https://bsdsec.net/articles/freebsd-announce-freebsd-errata-notice-freebsd-en-21-27-caroot?utm_source=bsdweekly): Several certificates were removed from the bundle after the latest release of FreeBSD 12.2 and FreeBSD 13.0. Additionally, an oversight in the root bundle processor included some roots that were not intended to be trusted for these purposes (SERVER_AUTH).
