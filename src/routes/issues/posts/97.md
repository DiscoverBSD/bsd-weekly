## News

[Wayland 1.20 Released With Proper FreeBSD Support, Protocol Additions](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Wayland-1.20-Released&utm_source=bsdweekly): While work on the core Wayland code itself has slowed down in recent years, Wayland 1.20 is a fairly notable update. In particular, this first Wayland release in nearly one year is bringing fully upstreamed FreeBSD support. All of the FreeBSD support patches have worked their way upstream into Wayland 1.20 and it's ready to be supported with this release. There is also now FreeBSD continuous integration (CI) test coverage to ensure the FreeBSD support remains in good shape and hopefully won't regress.

But stemming from a Phoronix Premium supporter recently requesting some fresh BSD benchmarks, here is a look at how DragonFlyBSD 6.0.1, FreeBSD 13.0, NetBSD 9.2, and OpenBSD 7.0 are competing against various Linux distributions like CentOS, Clear Linux, and Ubuntu.

[Adding Logitech Unifying Receiver support to OpenBSD, part 1](https://jwinnie.tilde.institute/blog/logitech-pt1.html?utm_source=bsdweekly): The Logitech Unifying Receiver is a small USB device that essentially acts as a wireless dongle, using a special protocol to communicate with Logitech wireless devices like mice and keyboards. Many Logitech products, including my mouse (the MX Master 2S) come with one of these devices. Thanks to the nature of the USB protocol, the Unifying Receiver is supported out-of-the-box on OpenBSD.
